<purr> nah, i'm gonna wait for him to come to me
<Sorcerer> the scene from Gladiator comes to mind
<Sorcerer> "I caught wind of a fish that waits on the bottom of the ocean for it's prey to take a nibble"
<Sorcerer> "The prey nibbles more and yet, the fish does nothing..."
<purr> Oh well, as long as I end up eaten in the end ;p
