* Gandalf should answer the phones at work with a different song lyric each time
<Gandalf> "I'm the operator with my pocket calculator. May I please have your U* IT Name?"
<ai> I just want to answer the phone "Fuck you, this is Ben, how can I help you?"
<Gandalf> heh :)
<ai> "I'd like to file a claim."  "Miss Scarlet, I don't know *nothin'* bout birthin' no babies!"
