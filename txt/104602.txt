<Antioch-F> Don't you hate people with karaoke scripts?
<Antioch-F> You know, they sit there and spam the lyrics to their song?
<Antioch-F> It's not enough to just have a script that aggitates everyone by going "I AM NOW PLAYING THIS AND THAT SONG IF ANYONE WANTS TO KNOW!"
<Antioch-F> No, they have to add karaoke to it.
<Antioch-F> Just in case anyone wants to know what the lyrics are for "Oh Man, I Woke Up In A Truck And My Butt Sort Of Hurts" by Billy West.
