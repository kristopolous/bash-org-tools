<[HZ]Mitlancer> Dont talk about death.... please my grandfather just died
<[HZ]Mitlancer> No serious he did just die....
<[HZ]Mitlancer> In a way im quite proud of him
<[HZ]Mitlancer> he died having sex to my grandma, he is 93 years old and was getting his thing on
<[HZ]Mitlancer> anyways my grandma said "We were doing it on sunday morning, it was sunday cause he could use the church bells to pace himself"
<[HZ]Mitlancer> i think he would be alive today if an icecream van didnt go past
