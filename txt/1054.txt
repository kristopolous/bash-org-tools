(wundr) gizm... why do you never use the same nick for more than 25 minutes?
(scolnick) i got tired of 'gizm'
(scolnick) at first i thought it was dope, just due to the fact that tht i liked the letters
(scolnick) g-i-z-m
(scolnick) but then it got old to me
(scolnick) so for now you can just call me lewis
