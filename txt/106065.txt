<Calisa> I read tampon boxes and manuals, (but who doesn't? Regardless of where you're at.)
<aeonite> do tampons really need a manual? insert tab a into slot b.
<Calisa> You'd be surprised, aeonite. There are always the people who don't know about if they can leave it in whilst they pee, what happens if it starts smelling extremely bad, what happens if they leave it in too long, or don't leave it in long enough..
<Calisa> Or pull it out too fast..

<Calisa> Temptation to ask what?
<semi> what happens when you pull it out too fast
<semi> i can assume its something like the movie backdraft.
