<StormCyko> i should get rich by making a gym for nerds with treadmills etc with LCD screens and internet access
<Gwala> StormCyko: you know that kinda sounds cool.
<AlpViper> you need incentive to make them run
<AlpViper> the screens would have to be powered by the running
* @Engush notes that most nerds who would go near a gym
<StormCyko> heh
<AlpViper> I know, make it if they drop below their targit HR/speed their net link turns off
