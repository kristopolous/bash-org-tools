(@Nick^) we were about to start an important exam yesterday
(@Nick^) and the male teacher says "any mobile phones turn them out and put them on the desk at the front"
(@Nick^) and my friend questioned him about whether it was necessary to put it on the desk at the front, blah blah
(@Nick^) then the teacher walks down the row of people to check, and says to my /other/ friend, "Is that a mobile phone in your pocket?"
(@Nick^) and my friend turned round and said "No he's just pleased to see you"
(@Nick^) I almost got kicked out for crying with laughter
