<NekoGuy> Hey Guys, long time no see, ever since that fucking war on terror started, I'm currently building several strategic size nuclear weapons, and wanted you're opinion, I've secured weapons grade plutonium, now I can't decide, gun type or implosive war heads? I'm gonna mount them on #1283-8171-200 Deep Strike
Cruise Missiles, so weight is an issue
<NekoGuy> um... wrong channel/server
<NekoGuy> sorry
<Xypher> if that was an attempt to be funny it sucked.
<NekoGuy> No, it was seriously the wrong channel/server
<NekoGuy> fucking idiot.
<Robby> implosive war head
<NekoGuy> Really? Thanks.
