<@sioux> it's going to be tricky tomorrow, i don't know if i'll make it
<@sioux> so if something happens to me, will one of you come and delete my pr0n?
<@sioux> i don't want my mother to find it
<@sioux> but please make sure i'm dead. wait until after the funeral. don't delete that shit while i'm still on life support or in a coma or something
<@sioux> if by some "act of god" or a donor organ i'm miraculously saved, and i come home and all my pr0n is gone, i'm going to kill myself
