<Allahkat> My wedding registry.
<Allahkat> http://shop.hbc.com/giftregistry/
<asshat> I know this is going to read stupid
<asshat> but why do you register
<asshat> to have people by you stuff??
<sueb[work> so people know what kind of gifts you want
<unchellmatt> To get swag, buddy!
<Allahkat> You register so people can buy you stuff that you picked out for your house.
<asshat> like an amazon wish list.
<unchellmatt> You get gifties!
<Allahkat> So you don't end up with ugly shit.
<asshat> ahh, I see.
<unchellmatt> That's going to happen anyway.
<Albatross> and so you don't get 20 food processors
<aeonite> You can do a lot of things with 20 food processors
<Allahkat> And 50 babies.
