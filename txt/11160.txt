<EazyCheez> I wonder if I can't unplug my 3 1/2"'s interface cable and use that with my old CD-ROM (Samsung)
<RvLeshrac> EazyCheez: No
<pupkick> samsung is radio shack for people with mental handicaps
<EazyCheez> RvLeshrac: I can't unplug my floppy disk drive's interface cable and put it into my CD-ROM?
