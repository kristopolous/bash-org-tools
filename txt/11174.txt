<@BitStream> well, I moved the couch down stairs
<@BitStream> so the new one can be put where the old one was
<helixblue> against the wall?
<@BitStream> yea
<helixblue> ahh.. I was hoping that sound was you cleaning the dishes
<helixblue> I ate my cereal for breakfast with measuring cups this morning.
<@BitStream> I was trying to get rid of as much stuff as possible before work, so thats less to do when I get back :/
<@BitStream> helixblue: did you look in the right cabinet
<@BitStream> there were bowls in there yesterday
<helixblue> bits: I used the measuring cups as spoons
