<Bendit> damn it, the cherries I bought yesterday are bad
<Bendit> cherry season is already over
<Bendit> :(
<Bendit> 1/3 of them seem to be almost rotting
<Bendit> and the rest have no flavour
<Bendit> there are so few things I like, WHY MUST THEY BE SEASONAL??!!?
<Bulk> ://
<omega> lucky for you cock isn't seasonal, so you may continue to enjoy it all year round.
<Bulk> im so glad you're in a good mood omega
