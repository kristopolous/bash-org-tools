<Hydrac7> Bukkake!
<Clockwork> hahaha
<Clockwork> BUKKAKE
<Alice`> I don't know why people giggle so much when someone mentions bukkake, let me tell you there's nothing funny about the manseed of 182 guys dripping down your face.
<Alice`> Well you might giggle a bit afterwards, but you don't mean it really.
<pot-shot> yeah you giggle, its like anxiety laughter, because oh fuck you are alive, for the fucking love of god you are alive, and it tastes like rice pudding, delicoius perfect rice pudding and there is literally gallons of it around you
