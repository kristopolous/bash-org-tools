<@Shively> yea well the guy at our college was becomming so popular that the student goverment put an article out on him
<+PickleHead> have you seen the book called Brown spots on the walls by "hooflung pooh"?
<+PickleHead> :P
<@Shively> he said he would stop if he could have a spot for somehting he wanted to say
<@Shively> so they gave it to him and he defended it as an art form
<+PickleHead> LMAO
<+PickleHead> you can't be serious
<@Shively> saying that feces drawn on walls is an expression of fecal art
<@Shively> so

<@Shively> the janitors responded with their own article
