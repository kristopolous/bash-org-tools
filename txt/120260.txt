<baka-san> a byte to eat? *groan*
<baka-san> I ate at a suhsi place once that called their pieces bits,
you could order a 4-bit nibble, and 8-bit byte, a 16-bit halfword, or a
32-bit word.
<baka-san> Some of their large combo platters were named after structs.
<baka-san> The TCP header that we ordered was very tasty.
