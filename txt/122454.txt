<GooRooPR> I've got cats, they like to puke (always on the fucking carpet, no matter what). While this bothers me, it at one time was tolerable when one kitty would puke the other would run in and eat it. I liked that system, I'd cheer them on, let them know that they where good kitties, pet them while they ate each
others puke, and what not. I even had it down to a perfect science where I'd reduce catfood to insure total puke clean
<GooRooPR> WTF? Do they expect me to eat it? Cause I'm not some bottomless pit, they puke a lot and I doubt I could keep up with that.
<GooRooPR> sorry for the flood :)
<revolver> heh
<DirtyPunk> You can tell someone needs to get out of the house and interact with humans when...
<revolver> ...they're cheering for puke eating kittens?
