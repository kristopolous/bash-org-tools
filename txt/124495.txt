<GameOver> I hate the drop off services
<GameOver> "$0.60 a pound! (minimum $5)
<GameOver> So you'd have to have bags full of heavy clothes
<Jorenko> damn
<GameOver> It'd be nice to just take the bus to work, drop off at Spin Cycle, then grab them when I go home
<GameOver> It's a Wash 'n' Fold service, so they seperate and whatnot, too.
<GameOver> ... but then comes the question -
<GameOver> - Do I really want a strange Mexican touching my panties?
