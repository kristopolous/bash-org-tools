<GreenWrecKingBall> hahaha
<GreenWrecKingBall> lucky it wasn't porn
<mad> omg
<mad> that's exactly what i was about to type
<mad> "lucky it was was rage against the machine, instead of this pron mpg i was about to load up"
<mad> since the only reason i realized my speakers were on is my feet could feel my sub kicking
