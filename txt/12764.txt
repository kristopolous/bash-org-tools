<JohnnyCat> the phantasm movies are good too. along the same thread of weird electronic
horror movie shit, a movie called cube is awesome
<JohnnyCat> http://us.imdb.com/Title?0123755
<JohnnyCat> very unique
<Somni> is that the one with the new Dax from DS9, and the robot cop from that Tek show
(by William Shatner)?
<JohnnyCat> i'm not sure.. i don't think so. it's about these people that get stuck in
the middle of this maze of cubes with doors on each face of the cube.  they
have to figure out whether it's safe to move from cube to cube, or they get
diced up
<Somni> yep, that's the one
<q[Simon]> That sounds like my office.
