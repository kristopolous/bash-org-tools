<Sir_Busby> haha I just got the most bizarre email...some dude that I went to university with year ago...telling me that he's dropped off Joe and Charlie at the airport two days ago and I should have met up with them by now...and that Joe can't wait to experience the good old days with me back in Kingston. haha  I
have no idea who Joe and Charlie are...and I've been to Kingston once in my life.  weird.
<Sir_Busby> mistaken identity
<Sir_Busby> I hope
