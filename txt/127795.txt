<EvaUnit02> I had a dream that my minivan charged up my stairs and tried to run me over in my bedroom
<EvaUnit02> its gets better
<EvaUnit02> So I charged it and wrestled it.
<EvaUnit02> I ended up overhead pressing it and capsising it on the floor
<EvaUnit02> then I proceeded to get on my waterbed and scream "OWNED" at it.
<EvaUnit02> what would sigmund have to say about that one
<sir-gold> that you feel your masculinity threatened by the fact that you drive a minivan
<cd|work> you got abused by a minivan in your childhood, and have an oedipus complex for your mother
<EvaUnit02> sir-gold now THAT is a possibility
