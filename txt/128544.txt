<xanesly> my husband and I felt stupid standing in the yard with dog saying "go potty! time to go potty!" in that dorky voice you use to talk to dogs and babies
<xanesly> (and some foreigners)
<xanesly> so we decided to use STDOUT instead
<fwoom> rofl
<xanesly> so we stand outside chirping "standardout! standardout!"
<xanesly> which has made it that whenever *we* need to go to the bathroom we refer to it as STDOUT
<xanesly> and when the dog has an accident, STDERR
<xanesly> sometimes I make myself sad.
