Jallak went to Hebrew school at this one temple for years...there was no rabbi, the head of the temple was the Cantor. He had long hair and he sang a lot. He would always give us long sermons about judiasm and goodness and all that, getting very very very passionate, his voice rising, tears nearly coming to his eyes
as he spoke of God aa a "Great cosmic teddy bear"...
<Jallak> It's been years since I went to Hebrew school...today I found out the Cantor had been arrested...for running a prostitution ring
