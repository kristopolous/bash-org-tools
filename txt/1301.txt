<homerj> I'm starting to have a real dislike of vegitarians
<homerj> and their holier then thou attitude
<noxnbox> we should eat them
<ryo-ohki> I bet they'd taste good.
<berzerker> my band has a 6 minute track about hating vegitarians
<ryo-ohki> Their body is like all meat, with just a little bit of fat.
<berzerker> and throwing steaks at their face
<homerj> because they must have some sort of rule that they tell you they are vegetarian like 5 times a day
<homerj> must be in the handbook "when you hvae the desire to eat meat, tell someone your a vegetarian"
<DigDug> you know, vegetarians are probably kosher too
