<Sumez> Q3 arena test
<Aximili> What is it?
<Sumez> don't you know what Quake is?!?
<Aximili> YES, I know what Quake is
<Aximili> But 'Q3' could have stood for 'Quicktime 3' as far as I know
<Sumez> Quicktime 3 arena :P
<SpyFrog> but isn't quicktime up in version 4?
<Sumez> Spy: not the multiplayer version :)
