<S1> i'm royally pissed off
<S1> i was giving my grandmother a ride into town so she could pick up her car
<S1> as i went through an intersection
<S1> a car making a right turn decided she diddn't want to go into the right lane wich was clear
<S1> nooooooooo she had to jump RIGHT in front of me
<S1> I had my 70 year old grand mother in the car
<S1> i almost rear ended the fuck out of an SUV
<S1> it could have easily put my grandmother in the hospital
<S1> bitch is lucky didn't rip her lungs out through her ass
<A1> you were going to rip your grandmothers lungs out through her ass?
