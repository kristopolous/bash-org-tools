<Exelcesior> I take it ALLL back about greenpeace type fanatics
<Exelcesior> no offence Ed
<Ed> hmm?
<Exelcesior> i was feeling suicidally bored so I visited a friend who's pretty enviro friendly
<Exelcesior> and I was talking to him as he watered his lawn, when this car pulled up
<Exelcesior> and this fat guy mooned him
<Exelcesior> so he screamed "FUCK! BEACHED WHALE!!" and turned the hose on him
<Ed> well, you have to keep them hydrated
