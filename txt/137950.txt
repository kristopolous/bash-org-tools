<LicknDrgn> I dunno, I haven't used a stock HSF in one of my machines since P200 days
<LicknDrgn> Which probably accounts for the fact I've got a cold CPU most days and fuck all else to my name :)
<LicknDrgn> Then again, the drug addict and alcoholic phases probably don't help either.
<LicknDrgn> Still, at least I can play video games drunk and stoned with the heater on :P
<LicknDrgn> And really, isn't that what's important in life?
<LicknDrgn> ...
<LicknDrgn> I wish I had a heater :(
