<bishead> man there is such a difference between online comp players and online console players.
<bishead> when i play cs my sexuality is attacked like a hundred times and my mother's weight mentioned 50 times.
<bishead> i was playing some guy in madden 2004 on ps2. and this guy was all like "hey man ur doing pretty good" and giving me tips and shit.
<bishead> but i've been playing cs too long. blurted out i wanna fuck ur mother with a pole.
<bishead> i kinda felt bad after.
