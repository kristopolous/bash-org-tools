<yrlnry> When was 'O Canada' introduced?  Must have been
pretty recently---maybe in the 1960's?
<ignatz> "A Canada" through "N Canada" were failures. Then
MacKenzie MacKenzie, a defrocked Mountie from Lard Heights,
Alberta, had a flash of inspiration one day while drinking
maple syrup.
<ignatz> The rest is history.
