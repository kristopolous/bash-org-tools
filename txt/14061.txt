|bardamu| y'know, sometimes i'm tempted to start a site at www.christianitykills.org detailing stories of christians who went on murderous rampages or killed themselves after praying and stuff
|bardamu| i'd get real controversial and get hundreds of thousands of hits
|bardamu| and then one day i'd pull the plug and replace it with an homage site to myself
|bardamu| surely that would be a good way to get lots of attention
