<Kindred> I got a question:  If you're driving in your car at the speed of light and you turn on your headlights, what happens?
<Devilbunny> Kindred: It's all in your imagination.  Putting "R-Type" stickers on your tarus will not give it enough extra horse power to reach any signficant fraction of the speed of light, no matter the size of your spoiler.
