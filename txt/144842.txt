<Costilled> "Try our new pepperoni pizza!"
<Costilled> and I'm left thinking
<Costilled> what's so new about it?
<Costilled> so I kick the guy in the throat
<Costilled> and take his wallet
<Mystech> o.o out
<Mystech> Or ouch
<Mystech> depending on how weirdly my brain is functioning tonight.
* karass has joined #jack
<Costilled> and then there was deer
<Costilled> don't get me started on deer
<karass> i wont
<karass> sorry i brought it up
<Costilled> but the pizza was hand tossed
<Costilled> the cook could have tossed off in the dough and we wouldn't know
<Mystech> Well like didn't you watch him make the dough, too?
<Costilled> He was kneading the dough as only a hooter girl could understand
<Costilled> you know if they drop the dough while tossing it, your pizza is free
<Mystech> Wow, man, that's deep.
<Costilled> Did you know
<Costilled> you can no longer get a pitcher of soda at pizza hut
<Costilled> ?
<karass> *gasp*
<Costilled> your refills are free
<karass> ive never gotten a pitcher of soda at pizza hut, so i dont think im terribly put off by the bad news
<Costilled> they just don't want you hording the soda
<Mystech> hehe
<Costilled> the glasses are rediculously small however
<Mystech> Arizona is the state of free refills.
<Mystech> all refills are free.
<Costilled> A smurf would get caught by his knickers if he decided to go for a swim
<Mystech> uhhhhh. . . huh?
<Costilled> and remember, it's never polite to place your tip to the server by aiming coins into his buttcrack
<Mystech> O.o  It's not polite for your server's buttcrack to be showing.
<Costilled> I didn't care
<Costilled> I was tipping him with the money I got from the guy I kicked in the throat
<Costilled> nevermind the fact that it was canadian
<Costilled> the money that is, not the buttcrack
<Mystech> Them canadians are infultrating out society.
<karass> apparently the new 20 is going to be peach colored
<Mystech> have you seen the new twenty dollar bills?
<Mystech> They are colored!
<mulefoot> They're peachy :)
<Mystech> Just like canadian funny-money!
<karass> i hear thats because they are made of human flesh
<Costilled> yes
<mulefoot> Soylent greenbacks?
<Costilled> soylent cash
<Mystech> By gadzer!
<Costilled> eeeevil
<Costilled> I must unshare my brainwave with you
* Costilled takes his brain out of the DMZ
<mulefoot> Its just a harmonic...here file on one one of your fillings.
<Costilled> I have no fillings
<Costilled> I'm crest's bitch
<mulefoot> In that case we're going to have to change the shape of your brain cavity. I'm going to need a power drill and an M-80.
<Costilled> scope flavored
<Costilled> the currency of the UK is multicolor
<Costilled> and also scratch and sniff
<Costilled> scratch it and it smells british
