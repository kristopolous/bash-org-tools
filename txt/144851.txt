<aqualung> that's weird, "douche" is the french word for shower
<aqualung> but in english, when used with the word "bag" it becomes an insult
<lefty> lol, you stupid SHOWER BAG
<aqualung> and it also sorta sounds like germany's name in german
<aqualung> if anyone were to associate germany with showers, it would be the jews, not the french ;)
<lefty> yeah, but what's even weirder is the french have a word for something they never use
