<BChikapa> wan 2 cybar?
<Calisa> We have sex three times, it's fun, I get pregnant, Jimmy needs a daddy.
<BChikapa> I refuse to pay child support, and lengthy leagal battles ensue.
<Calisa> Jimmy becomes torn by his dashed hopes of having a father, so he murders you while you're sleeping on the job at the toll booth.
<BChikapa> All my family members despise me, and as a result no one has any money to pay for my disposal.
<BChikapa> I am unceremoniously dumped into the Hudson River, wrapped in a cheap plastic tarp.
