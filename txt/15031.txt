<Whoever>So I'm sitting at the lunch table with mostly girls and the conversation wanders about the usual subjects.
<Whoever>Eventually someone say the word "Jizz" And that goody goody girl with the 4.0 GPA and who is very sweet and innocent says, "whats jizz?"
<Whoever>Silence and muffled laughter ensues, one of the girls says "Its something guys do."
<Whoever>So she says "...oh... okay.."
<Whoever>Next period, english class, miss clueless raises her hand.
<Whoever>"Excuse me, can I go to the Lav, I have to Jizz."
