<Birk> Today this guest speaker came to our class to talk to us about the local college and the programs they offer.
<Birk> so he goes around the rooms asking people what they want to major in
<Birk> one kid goes "Ii'm not sure yet, I'll either be a Computer Programmer or a Priest"
<Birk> and I'm like " Either way you won't get laid"
<Birk> I got a 2 day suspension for saying that.
<Jaguar> LMAO !
