<@arfbot> did you ever do that project in elementary school
<@arfbot> where you decided to give your oral presentation in the form of a rap
<@arfbot> so you'd get your best friend to come up with you and go "POOT-POOT-CHIT*** CHIT *** POOT-PPOT-CHIT!!!"
<@arfbot> while you rapped
<@arfbot> i think i did that once for my project on nintendo
