<Merlin> according to Time-Warner, if you channel surf or mute commercial breaks you are a thief
<Merlin> so lemme see, if I download MP3s the RIAA hates me, if I dub a movie off HBO the MPAA hates me, if I skip commercials the TV execs hate me...
<Merlin> am I allowed to store leftover pizza in the fridge and eat it the next day, or will Pizza Hut sue me?
