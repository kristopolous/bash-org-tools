<marcus> hahah. these guys have a dedicated oracle server... an e3500 with 4
cpus and 4gb of RAM
<marcus> they've had it for 2 years now
<marcus> doing nothing but oracle
<marcus> with oracle configure to use no more than 128MB of ram
<marcus> and recently they've been complaining about performance
<marcus> they thought maybe they needed more memory
<marcus> i was like "uhhh. your dataset is smaller than physical ram"
