<LoverMan> Yeah, I remember when my boss' wife had computer problems...she
asked me to go over and help fix it, she wasn't seeing anything on the
screen and has rebooted, checked the connections, etc...so I go over there
<LoverMan> And the monitor wasn't turned on.  Her excuse?  "Oh, I never turn
it off so I didn't think to check that."
