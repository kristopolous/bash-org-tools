<Actaeon> Stupid three-dimensional universe.
<Violetnite> Better than a two dimensional universe.
<Actaeon> Well, depends on the dimensions.
<Actaeon> And really, it is a good/bad thing.
<Violetnite> What is the good and bad.
<Violetnite> Just curious.
<Actaeon> The three-dimensionality makes it so that I am seperated from people I meet on here by actualy traversable space. On the other hand, three dimensions are necessary for tits. So, guess I just have to deal.
