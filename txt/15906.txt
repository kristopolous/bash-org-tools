<PoisonPen> Those of us who were on Usenet back when it was all computer geeks,
scientists, and university students remember when the tsunami of AOLusers came

the AOLusers as veritable towering geniuses compared to the slope-browed,
mouth-breathing idiocy they displayed.  They made "ME TOOO!" sound like a work
of Shakespeare.
