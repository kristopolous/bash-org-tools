<SamGod> I turn on the faucet to wash my hands, put my hands in the stream of water, and all of a sudden I stop and get TOTALLY grossed out and I'mlike "Oh GROSS, dammit!!" thinking I just got a ton of piss all over my hands.  Then I realize it's a freaking FAUCET and water comes out of it, not piss.  What the HELL
was my brain thinking?
