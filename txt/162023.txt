<McFarlan> Those bastards did somthing terrible today
<McFarlan> They put a big picture of Goatse in the lunchroom trash can at breakfast this morning
<McFarlan> People would come to dump thier trays...and stop and look down in the trash
<McFarlan> It was really funny, but wrong at the same time :/
<Flex-Work> i would have thrown up
<Flex-Work> :P
<McFarlan> I thought a couple were
<McFarlan> Then the principal walks over
<McFarlan> Grabs the trashcan, and walks out of the cafeteria
<Moonsaber> Do you think they linked it to you? :-)
<McFarlan> I'm hoping not
