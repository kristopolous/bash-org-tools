<Moe_Rahn> Hey, I actually got mail at 1:40!
<Moe_Rahn> Spam mail, but still.
<MagFire> i didn't even get that
<Moe_Rahn> Haha.
<Moe_Rahn> I'm more specialer.
<Moe_Rahn> All the recently legal 18-year-olds are after my wang, apparently.
<Moe_Rahn> If this many teens were after me in high school, I'd still be there.
<MagFire> I'm still pretty excited about the potential for getting a larger fckstck and bigger boobs
<MagFire>:D
<Moe_Rahn> If everyone responded to those ads, we'd all be walking about with 8-mile-long cocks and like size 88ZZZ breasts.
<Moe_Rahn> Those inches would add up...
<Moe_Rahn> Three inches here, five there, and all of a sudden, WHAM! Mr. Happy's a frickin' behemoth!
<MagFire> I don't think I would want like a 14 inch cock, personally.
<Moe_Rahn> It's odd, though... you always get mail about increasing penis length, but never penis girth.
<Moe_Rahn> What good is 14 inches or 3 feet or whatever if it's got no girth to back it up...?
<MagFire> what good is 14 inches or 3 feet if you don't have a warm place to put it?
<MagFire> =)
<Moe_Rahn> Point made.
<Moe_Rahn> You could like put it through a person.
<Moe_Rahn> Or you could be a dancer, I guess.
<Moe_Rahn> Some people might pay money to see a 3 foot cock.
<MagFire> You'd probably be pretty popular in porn
<MagFire> but seriously...how would you even WALK with a 3 foot penis?
<Moe_Rahn> Yeah.
<Moe_Rahn> You'd have to get like a sheath for it.
<MagFire> rofl
<Moe_Rahn> But, would it be 3 feet up or down?
<Moe_Rahn> That could make a difference.
<MagFire> Okay, this conversation is finished.
<Moe_Rahn> Okay... boy, the shit you think of at 2 AM.
<Moe_Rahn> So... um...
<Moe_Rahn> How 'bout them Rams?
<MagFire> I dunno. How 'bout them?
<Moe_Rahn> I dunno either... I was trying to make non-penis-related conversation.
