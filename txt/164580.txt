<PufPufPaz> hugo: you were kidding about marrying a 19/f/ca right?
<hugo> PufPufPaz: Um.. actually, no, and she's a bisexual vegetarian pagan to boot.
<hugo> My life is weird.
<PufPufPaz> hugo: sounds more interesting than weird.
<hugo> PufPufPaz: May I /msg you? It's complicated. :)
<PufPufPaz> hugo: yeh hope is not for heart related matters, i suck at that
<hugo> Nah, it's just that I met Kate in a chat-room
<hugo> and now she's sitting 10 feet away and we sometimes go into the same chat room and chat w/ everyone.
<PufPufPaz> whats wrong with that?

<steltek> Is she involving you in that emulation? If not, you should ask her to demonstrate. :)
<hugo> PufPufPaz: That's not the half of it. She bought one of those  make-your-own-dildo kits because she wanted her best friend to have a 'copy' of me
<PufPufPaz> hugo: tmi
<hugo> but you gotta trim your..um.. before you use the mould
<hugo> so I got this .. thing stuck on me. Looked like I was a human candle.
<PufPufPaz> hugo: really, tmi
