<0dan0> and I am simulating california in my own room
<0dan0> I have the humidifier going onto my heater, creating a warm front
<0dan0> then the window is opening letting in the cold dry air, creating a cold front
<0dan0> soon there will be precipitation as the warm air mass is forced to rise by the denser cold air
<0dan0> and my room will be a tropical rainforest
<cran> or it will be a room full of tepid air and one dumb homo
