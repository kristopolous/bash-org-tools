<CharlieB> and nah, I'm trying to get fbsd to see my mp3 player
<CharlieB> and the batteries just died
<w32nachi> CharlieB: pitty... it would've been a more entertaining story if it had involved a dildo...
<CharlieB> fair enough
<CharlieB>  I'm trying to get fbsd to see my usb dildo
<w32nachi> excellent...
<CharlieB> and the batteries just died
<w32nachi> ...so, do you program in sound effects, motion patterns, or something else?
<CharlieB> lol
<CharlieB> yeah.. it has a built in mp3 player
<w32nachi> wow... that's some vibrator!
<w32nachi> is it the iCock, from apple?
<BalDown> no, it's made by M$ and defaults to giving it to you up the ass...
