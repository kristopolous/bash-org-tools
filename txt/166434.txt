<TheShadowHunter> Im still afraid to ask if I did anything unusual while on morphine. I dont remember it really affecting me at all but for all I know I couldve been running up and down the halls naked and pushing old people out of wheelchairs.
<TheShadowHunter> Thats something I prefer to do while entirely coherent.
