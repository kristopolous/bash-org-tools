<`Riku> Ok, so there's this UN meeting, and there are a lot of important people in there discussing how to get a peace in Iraq
<`Riku> after the meeting the President of France comes to George Bush and says: "Mr. Bush, there's something I'd like to ask... My son is a huge Star Trek fan, and he'd like to know why there are no Arabians on the show?"
<`Riku> Bush thinks a second, then smirks and says;
<`Riku> "Cause it takes place in the future."
