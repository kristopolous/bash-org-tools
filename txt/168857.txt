<mojo> I want me a pet monkey.
<Synthetic> My aunt had one, the smell was ungodly. It was allways beating off and if it got scared it would deficate in it's hand a throw it.
<mojo> I know, that's why I want one. If it can beat it's self off then I can teach it how to do it to me.
<synthetic> ...
<Capin> Um... so anyway I went to the zoo this one time and one of the gorillas stole my dad's wallet!
<Synthetic> That was no gorilla, it was a black guy in a fur coat. The son of a bitch has my shoes.
<mojo> I still want a monkey if anybody cares.
