#17335 +(184)- [X]
<Balatro> Electroly:  It died on me once and wouldn't restart.  I had to ps -aux or whatever the fuck it is and kill the process.  Then it started fine.
<Electroly> ah, nothing good old `ps aux | grep Proteus | awk '{print $2 }' | xargs kill -9` won't fix.
<Electroly> much better, that worked.
* Gandalf stares at Electroly
<Gandalf> And I thought I was a Unix dork.
<Balatro> Yeah, it was so much less effort to do that then to type a command, quickly see the process and kill it by PID :)
<Electroly> you are a unix dork
<Electroly> Balatro: there were like 10 Proteus processes, dude.
<Balatro> Funny, I had 1 ;)
<Electroly> dunno where these all came from, but i killed them all.
<Electroly> now all is well
<Gandalf> Electroly: I understand ps, grep, and xargs. Explain how that awk thinger works, though? :)
<Electroly> Gandalf: awk is pretty simple.  it treats the stdin as a bunch of columns
<Electroly> and lets you reformat the output.  { print $n } is typical, where n is the column number to print out.
<kurros> AWK AWK MOTHER FUCKER
<Electroly> it uses whitespace as the column delimiter by default, but you can change that by some argument to it
<Gandalf> ah, and in ps aux the PID is the second column, thus $2, right?
<Electroly> yup
<Electroly> you can do other stuff with awk, like awk '{ print "Whee!  The PID for " $10 " is " $2 "!" }'
<Balatro> It makes me hot when you talk unix.
<Electroly> rm -rf /home/Balatro
<Balatro> That's /homo/Balatro, honey :)
