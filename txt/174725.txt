<MST3Claye> there's a site out there that shows people beating super monkey ball levels really really fast.
<Merlin> I plan on setting a new world speed record for Monopoly one of these days...
<Merlin> It's called we sit down, setup the game, I pull a gun and go "look bitches, give me all your money and nobody gets hurt!"
<Merlin> then I take the thimble hostage at the Water Works and force everyone to surrender to me, then I win the game.
<Merlin> I figure my friends suck so much, I could win it in about 30 seconds with that strategy.
