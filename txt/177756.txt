<cagan> heh, my little sister bought vice city :)
<spanky> such a cool game
<cagan> i don't think my sister has any intention of completing it
<cagan> she just likes driving around, and occasionally killing people
<spanky> lol, dont we all?
<cagan> she has cars in her garage ... and if they get damage, she carefully drives to a paint place, then keeps going in and out till its a colour she approves off
<spanky> hehe
