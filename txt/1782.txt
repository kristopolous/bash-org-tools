<bludstone> so like, with anime now
<bludstone> some otaku dude in japan encodes it, uploads it.. it spreads
<bludstone> and its available before the airtime cuz of timezone changes ermshtn

<bludstone> dammit, i need to get laid.
<SiamShade> where the fuck did that come from
<SiamShade> you're talking about anime and how it spreads then "i need to get laid."
<SiamShade> oh wait
<SiamShade> that makes perfect sense
