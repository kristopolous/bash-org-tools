<InSoc> DEAR INVESTORS: HOW NOT TO MAKE STOCKS GO DOWN: _STOP SELLING STUFF_
<InSoc> Heh.
<Destruya> That can only be done by incredibly large amounts of trading
<MrEnthusiasm> it doesnt help that a bunch of big companies are going down in flames so people panic and sell thinking others will also burn and in fact promote them to die as well
<quatoria> there's every reason for investors to think other companies will burn
<quatoria> the recent accounting problems are indicitive of a much larger decay within corporate america, and investors know it.
<quatoria> they also know bush trying to present himself as a corporate reformer is a total frigging joke.
