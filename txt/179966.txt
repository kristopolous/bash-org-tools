<Tremolo> All right, you want a story eh? Welll fine
<Tremolo> "One day in the middle of the night, two dead boys got up for a fight. Back to back they faced each other, drew their swords and shot each other. A deaf policeman heard the noise and came to shoot the two dead boys. If you dont believe this lie is true, ask the blind man he saw it too,"
