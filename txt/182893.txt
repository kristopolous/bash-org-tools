<Potato> A couple years back, my friend had the greatest christmas tree of all time
<Potato> We were 'round at his place, having a post-pissup drink/laugh at lightweight bastards and two cops came in because of a noise complaint
<Potato> One of them walks towards the open back door while the other does the usual "Why are you making so much noise" question routine
<Potato> The friend in question goes pale as he sees the cop stick his head in the door and only look one way before deciding they were wasting their time
<Potato> When they'd fucked off, I asked him what was wrong, he pointed in the other direction and told me to go check out the christmas tree the cop missed
<Potato> I stick my head in the door and lo, a 6 foot tall pot plant, complete with tinsel and presents around the base, is sitting in the corner, facing me off, taunting me, goin' "Yeah, fucker, I'm a 6 foot tall pot plant. Ya wanna piece of me, bitch?"
