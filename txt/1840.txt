<Guilty> Me: "I think I'll send a message" | ICQ: Wait wait, wouldnt you like to search the web? The white pages? The yellow pages? Want me to check your email? Your stocks? On your dog?  Look someone on your list has a birthday coming up oh shit go buy them a gift here. But first check your ICQ Pager(TM) and make a
few internet phone calls.  Go, do it, I'll be here, moving myself to random parts of the screen so I'm never in the position you left me
