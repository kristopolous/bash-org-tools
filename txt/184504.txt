<MJL> The only thing that pisses me off is when someone randomly enters my room at night during happy time.
<MJL> It's like a mad scramble to look innocent
<MJL> And it's a lose lose situation
<MJL> Because it's obvious you're trying to cover it up
<MJL> But I guess it's better than staring at your mother with your penis hanging out and asking what's up.
