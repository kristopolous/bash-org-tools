sUpRbritt420: im writing a persuasive essay on why the drinking age should be lowered and breathalyzers should be installed in cars while they are being built
sUpRbritt420: how do you write a persuasive essay ------like are you allowed to ask a question?
VV1Z0: Sure
VV1Z0: You can start with a question like "Ever wondered why there are so many underage drinking arrests? Because it's fun, that's why.  We should let teenagers get as drunk as they want, so long as they don't hurt others."
