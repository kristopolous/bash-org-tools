<Da5id> bwahahahahahaha!
<Da5id> k
<Da5id> check this stuff out
<Da5id> the sign at the student eating facility that i work at says "babcock frozen yogurt"
<Da5id> but 'babcock' is on one line, and 'frozen yogurt' is on the other
<Da5id> and there's two switches for the sign
<Da5id> now, one would THINK that one switch would be for "babcock" and the other for "frozen yogurt"
<Da5id> but no
<Da5id> one switch is for "bab/frozen"
<Da5id> and the other is for "cock/yogurt"
<%Freakazoid> lol
<Da5id> we just closed, like, an hour ago
<Da5id> guess what the sign was left saying?
<Da5id> O:)
