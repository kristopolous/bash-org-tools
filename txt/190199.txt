<Mooseka> IF GOD IS SO POWERFUL, WHY DID IT TAKE 7 DAYS TO CREATE THE EARTH.
<Mooseka> AND IF IT DID TAKE 7 DAYS, HOW LONG HAS IT TAKEN TO CREATE THE UNIVERSE?
<Mooseka> A PRETTY LONG TIME I'D THINK!
<Cef> to god a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years is liek a day
<Cef> thats in the bible
<Mooseka> SO IT TOOK GOD 7000 YEARS TO MAKE THE EARTH?
<Mooseka> HOW THE FUCK IS HE POWERFUL THEN
<Mooseka> I COULD MAKE THE EARTH OUT OF LEGOS IN 7000 YEARS.
