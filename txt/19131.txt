<LawrenceC> Some of us in another channel have come up with the perfect replacement for the Pledge of Allegiance!
<LawrenceC> You see, our genious plan was to take the Pledge of Allegiance, as it stands, and run it through Babelfish a few times.
<LawrenceC> So, after transating it to Spanish and back, then to Korean and back, we came up with:
* Jinnai|Shigoto fears lawrence's next statement :P
* Leliel also :P
<LawrenceC> "Me with the flag of United States of United States the republic which it stops, in the nation all for a loyalty, in freedom and process, it promised in the shoes lower part it will be able to divide c."
<Suika|away> divide c!
<Suika|away> that's so moving
