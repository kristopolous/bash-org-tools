<peng> yes
<peng> the government makes up an airplane
<peng> with a passenger list and all
<peng> to coincide with the WTC
<kisama> then dick cheney sticks a finger up gwb's ass
<peng> this shit goes deep man
<kisama> and says "it's gonna be ok, baby bush, it's alright."
<kisama> "have a teddy bear"
