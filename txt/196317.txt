<STEELE1381> I just spent about 10 minutes taking an online IQ test that popped up onto my screen.
<STEELE1381> Then, when I was finished, they made me fill out all this registration stuff before giving me my score.
<sirhc614> How'd you do?
<STEELE1381> Judging by the fact that I game them my email address to find out a number representing my intelligence that they semi-randomly calculated, I think I failed.
