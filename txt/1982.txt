<ToastyGhost> Is that a roll of pennies in your pocket, or do you just have an incredibly small and slender penis?
<TheVortex> you talking to toen? more like dimes.
<Toen> actually it's a roll of pennies in my pocket. But that ain't a gatorate bottle in my other pocket.
<TheVortex> Ah. Powerade.
<ToastyGhost> Powerade.
<Toen> penis, actually
<ToastyGhost> Yes, severed penis of someone else, in a gatorade bottle.
<TheVortex> dude, that's pretty sick, cutting someone else's penis off like that
<ToastyGhost> DAMN! SAME THOUGHTS!
<Toen> I HATE YOU BOTH ;_;
<TheVortex> GET OUT OF MY HEAD TOASTYGHOST
