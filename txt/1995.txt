<Digested> nothing like coming back to irc after a night of partying
<Digested> and nothing like partying on a monday night and then driving home at the same time as everyone is driving to work
<Digested> and laughing at them
<Digested> :D
<MadHatter> Not everyone can live with their parents
<Digested> that's why i'm taking advantage of the situation while i still can
<Digested> the main problem with sharing a house with parents is bringing a girl home
<Digested> but it isn't really a problem for me... heh
<MadHatter> hehe
