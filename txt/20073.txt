<Calculus> Ah...a dark room, approximately 25 computers, Debian ISOs for six platforms, and two hundred and four CD-Rs.  It's going to be a wiiiild night.
<DamienRoc> Only you would consider that a wild night, Calc.
<Mechalink> Not only Calc.

<DamienRoc> You get fiberglass in your lungs and lose 10 years to your life?
<Calculus> Well, that too...
