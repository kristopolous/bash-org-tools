<Daggson> I think it's funny when people ask for romantic advice in IRC channels.
<Michi||Cleaning> O_o
<Michi||Cleaning> "Daggs... how do I make Johnny fall in love with me?"
<Daggson> Because, you know, the geeks and nerds always have the most experience with their respective opposite sex.
<Michi||Cleaning> <-Is a nerd
<Michi||Cleaning> A neat freak too...
<Daggson> It'd be like going into the highschool football team's locker room and asking if anyone can help you with your Unix code.
