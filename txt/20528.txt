<Nugget94M> I remember when my mom first got on the internet, about 2 years ago. She *almost* had it figured out.
<Nugget94M> she managed to use a search engine, and found a web page she was interested in.
<Nugget94M> so she printed it out, stuck it in an envelope, and _mailed_ it to me so I could see it too.
<acidkill> Nugget94M: hehe, i guess she didnt know about email?
<Nugget94M> she knew about email. it just never dawned on her that she could mail the url.
