<Locke|Away> Have you considred sacrificing a pig to appease the evil spirits plaguing your internet connection, Serge?  Western medicine seems to have failed you.
<Abe> well, right now it all comes down to the network engineer's bad back. if he hadn't hurt his back, he would have fixed it by now; as it is, he's off until monday
<Locke|Away> Well, have you considered sacrificing a pig for his back?  An evil dab may have followed him home from work.  It might be eating his marrow.
<Locke|Away> Look, I'm hungry and I want some fucking bacon.  Just kill a pig already.
