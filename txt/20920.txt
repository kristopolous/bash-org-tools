<[PtFe]Harrison> If I ever purchased a firearm, it'd have to be something like...  I dunno...  A fifty calibur sniper rifle.  If I'm going to get a gun, I might as well be able to punch a hole in a tank, you know?
<[LsR]Darrian> lol
<[LsR]Hotwire> law launcher for me. if it dont blow stuff up, i dont want it.
<[LsR]Darrian> I just want something I can whip out in the middle of a strip joint and yell "suck it, bitch!"
