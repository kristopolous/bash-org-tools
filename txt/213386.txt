<Bunge> The Clinton administration created a $300 billion surplus, in a few years the Bush administration has turned that into a $400 billion deficit, mostly spent on "the war on terror"
<Bunge> and they claim that is good financial management?
<Bunge> they are a bunch of cnuts
<Kormiic> At least now I'm not terrified...
<Kormiic> Oh... wait...
