<Stiffler> How's it going.
<FlyNavy> eh
<FlyNavy> been better
<FlyNavy> pretty much out of resin to smoke...
<FlyNavy> and I still don't have:
<FlyNavy> a job
<FlyNavy> a car
<FlyNavy> money
<FlyNavy> weed
<FlyNavy> or pussy
<Stiffler> So basically...
<Stiffler> It's all the same.
<Stiffler> ROFL
<FlyNavy> I need a job so I can get a car so I can have money to buy weed
<FlyNavy> which I'll then use to get pussy
<Stiffler> Indeed
<FlyNavy> which'll then need to be maintained by a job
<FlyNavy> which to get I'll need a car
<FlyNavy> and for that I need money
<Stiffler> But you see, you first need the pussy to get the weed to get the money to get the car to the job..
<FlyNavy> so I could try selling weed
<FlyNavy> :D
<FlyNavy> exactly...if I had some pussy, she could tell me where to get weed to I could sell it to buy a car to get a job to maintin the pussy that I'll get with weed which I'll buy with money left over from buying a car that I earned at my job
<Stiffler> Indeed
