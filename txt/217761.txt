DinjackPD: so I'm studying for my history final
DinjackPD: And there's this old WW2 propaganda poster
DinjackPD: Of this guy driving along alone with an outline of hitler next to him
DinjackPD: And the title is
DinjackPD: 'WHEN YOU RIDE ALONE, YOU RIDE WITH HITLER!'
DinjackPD: isn't that contradicting?
Jahman98: hahahahah
Jahman98: yeah
Jahman98: that's great stuff
DinjackPD: 'When you ride alone, you ride ALONE, however you do use up valuable gas that is intended for the war effort and thus make it easier for the Nazis to win. You Jew hating BASTARD.'
