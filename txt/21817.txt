<gfm> barubary -- ok so you've spent 9 months on this, have nothing
conclusive to show for it, and even if you did manage to find
something, which we'd all bet large sums of money isn't going to
happen, its useless except to a handful of warez kiddiez in #psx?
<gfm> Don't you have anything better to do?
<Barubary> nope
<gfm> oh
<gfm> well, ok then.
<gfm> good luck
