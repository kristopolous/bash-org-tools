Sushispook: so we're swapping out all these old pc's with newer ones
Sushispook: and we're stacking them up in piles in the cube next to me
Sushispook: and all the old ones have various notes on them, since some have been pillaged for parts
Sushispook: i go into the cube to talk to the rentatech and see how he's doing, and i lean up against the cube
Sushispook: and i end up walking out with one of those notes stuck to my ass
Sushispook: and just try and guess what that note said
Sushispook: NEEDS HARD DRIVE
Sushispook: right on my ass
