(lupin) yeah
(lupin) I'm pissed
(lupin) I went to Wal Mart and they stopped me because I had a backpack
(lupin) and they said "We'll have to hold that for you because of recent events"
(lupin) and I said "Listen, if I were a terrorist, I think I'd pick a better place to bomb or infect than a backwater WalMart.  I'd at least go hit the Super Wal Mart in Bryan because I could go get McDonalds on the way to blowing it up."
(lupin) and they let me keep my bag
