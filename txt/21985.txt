(kitten) One time, a friend and I were attempting to install a CD burner in his machine.
(kitten) The intstructions were translated from Japanese to English - not too bad a job, either.
(kitten) However, occasionally, they will come across a word that simply does not translate, so they will use the phoenetic Japanese.
(kitten) So we wound up with, you click here, you run this, you do that, ho-shin-kai, you remove the disk..
(kitten) Took it to a friend's father who speaks passable Japanese - he said "I think it means something like, 'to breathe the mystic spirit of the dark dragon'."
(kitten) What that has to do with CD burners, I couldn't tell you.
(kitten) But anyway.
(kitten) I believe that 'zig' is akin to this phenomenon.
