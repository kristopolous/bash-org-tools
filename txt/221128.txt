<Rhodz> bah
<Rhodz> so sick of this superbowl crap
<Rhodz> they just cater to the lowest common denominator
<Rhodz> I half expect next year's superbowl to be a reality home improvement show where the two teams have to build the stadium and when they're done get voted off their teams one by one until the last two have to compete in a singing contest judges by that simon guy from american idol, and the winner wins the
superbowl alone, and gets a free makeover from the queer eye dudes and then a week later finds out he was "punk'd" and he didnt really win anything
<Rhodz> ..
<Rhodz> wait...that sounds like an awesome show
