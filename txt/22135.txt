<kentyman> Show the following problem is NP-complete:  The dominating-set problem:  given a graph G and an integer k, does there exist a subset S of G with k nodes such that each node is either in S or adjacent to a node of S?
<Oax> exactly k nodes
<kentyman> yes, but adding nodes wouldn't change it, no?
<Oax> no
<Oax> it's monotone
<kentyman> like my prof
