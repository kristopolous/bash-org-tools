<mindy>why are men so insecure about how long their penises are?
<topbottom>it's not that we're insecure, it's just something we like to keep track of, like our shoe size
<topbottom>men need to know this so that when a chick asks us how long our cock is, we know what to multiply by 1.5
<mikeyL>yeah, so i'd say 6 inches
<mikeyL>wait
<mikeyL>fuck
<topbottom>lol
