<Stingray_> JeyK: we should open a site similar to thinkgeek where people can order IRC-related stuff
<JeyK> Stingray_: I'm scared of dot bombs!
<Stingray_> like shirts that say "My dad can /kick your dad"
<JeyK> haha
<SamBecket> lol
<JeyK> "Your son may have straight As, but my son can /kick your son"
<Stingray_> lol
<Stingray_> that would be a good bumper sticker
<Stingray_> alas, I'm a bit young to pull that off
<JeyK> I've seen "Your son may have straight As, but my son can ____ your son" a lot
<Stingray_> how about "Your son may have straight As, but your daughter has double Ds and don't my son know it!"
<JeyK> ROFL
