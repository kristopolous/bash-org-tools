(cubeman) there is a big fat bug in Joust 2
(cubeman) I just found it
(cubeman) you can make the pterry kill itself in the lava
(cubeman) you kill a few then...
(cubeman) you have a screen where you don't advance
(BenJos) So what if you have the bug kill itself in the lava? I mean what does the big fat bug in Joust 2 have to do with it?
(cubeman) ummmm
(cubeman) I believe you are trying to obfuscate my senses
