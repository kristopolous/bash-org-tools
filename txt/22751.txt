<jimblob> did you know that haggii (thats more than one haggis) have two legs shorter than the other two, this enables them to run around hills very quickly, the down side is  that , depending on which two legs are the shortest, the haggis can only run round the hills in one direction
<miriamb> really Jim?
<miriamb> gosh
