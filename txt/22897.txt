<es0> how you use TCp with an abacus?
<%sluggo> TCP as in a TCP/IP stack?
<@Amish> that would be a fancy abacus, indeed :)
<%sluggo> that would be about as useful as half of the RFCs out there
<%sluggo> like "wireless TCP/IP networking via carrier pigeons"
<@Amish> yeah, B. F. Skinner was really pushing for that one
