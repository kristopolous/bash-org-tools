* Vod recites the Mr T prayer
<Vod> Oh Baracus, who was in 'Nam, Mr. T be thy name. Thy van will come with Face and Hannibal, on Earth as it is on TV-Land.
<Vod> Give us this day, our daily milk, and pity us fools, as we pity the fools who cross us.
<Vod> Lead us not into airplanes, and deliver us from Murdock. For thine is the Mohawk and the Van, and the Gold Chains, forever, or at least until the mid-80's. Amen.
