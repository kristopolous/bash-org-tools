<JakeStone> *shift change!*
<geo--> that's a very pretty shift, jake.
<geo--> don't think I've seen you wear that one before.
<JakeStone> thank you geo.  I got it at Macy's.
<geo--> the pearls complement it well.
<JakeStone> I'm thinking though, that the tiara is a bit much though.
<geo--> well, only because you're wearing it as a codpiece.
