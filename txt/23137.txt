<dreamkast0r> This is the abosolute worst joke I've ever found on a string cheese wrapper.
<kingLatency> what is it?
<dreamkast0r> "What happened to the fireproof, unbreakable, shockproof, waterproof watch?"
<dreamkast0r> "It is lost!"
<dreamkast0r> They just aren't trying anymore.
<dreamkast0r> That's not a joke.
<dreamkast0r> It's a sad story.
