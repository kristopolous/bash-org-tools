<Tempest> Has anyone seen Passion of the Christ?
<Yuki> I heard the guy playing Jesus was struck by lighting twice while working on the set.
<Mister Mittens> I've heard that as well... And I think someone else on the set was hit by lightning as well... not sure
<Quinton> GOOD MOVIE
<Teal> They weren't hit by lightning. They were smote. There's a difference.
