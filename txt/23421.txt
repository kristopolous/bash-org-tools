<LuminousPath> somebody after with the main envi'-boy it has the recovery;)
<LuminousPath> I have succeeded in confusing them all.
<LuminousPath> Now, in the confusion, I shall cause an overload in the main mIRC hub.
<LuminousPath> This will cause horendous bottlenecks, netsplits and profile colapses
<LuminousPath> In the confusion, I shall route all transmissions through Area 51.
<LuminousPath> This will overload their main servers, causing them to have a netsplit
<LuminousPath> I shall repeat this process thosands of times over...
<YusukeUrameshi> LuminousPath: you do not know much of IRC do you?
