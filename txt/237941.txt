<Fox_Alan> when you have to resort to using pickup lines from bash.org things are bad :)
<Borlath_Mon> Yeah, but nobody I know over here READS bash.org - I read a bit before I go out, and I'm the life of the party. Telling jokes, making fun of things...
<Borlath_Mon> Of course, I -did- get into a bit of trouble when I went to the Black Pride thing.
<Borlath_Mon> That antique farm equipment joke didn't go down too well.
