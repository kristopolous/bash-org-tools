<doug-> moral dilemma: i just found a pak of 18 chicken legs in the deep freezer, however the label says 'best if used by 06-12-01'.... do i cook it up for the kidz and avoid having to spend money on take out?  i'm not all that hungry myself anyway =]
<Prozzy> I say go for it. If they die, at least you know.
<doug-> hmm, never actually thought about *death*, just figured on projectile diarrhea, etc... now insurance policies come into play... this could be a win-win-win-lose-win situation i have here
