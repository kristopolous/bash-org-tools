<Sherazard> some times i wonder when i was 10 if i had hair in certian areas
<Sherazard> sometimes i wish i could go back in time and check
<Sherazard> just to put my curiosity to rest, you know
<Sherazard> but then i think, what would i say to 10 year old me?
<Sherazard> "hi, i'm your future self, take your pants off. i need to check something"
<Sherazard> that'd probably scar me
<Sherazard> and as a result my current self would be even *more* fucked up
