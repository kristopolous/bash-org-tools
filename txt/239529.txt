* +Makkavelli is back from "Carefully soldering a mod chip into my PS2." I was gone for 1hr 51mins <+Makkavelli> As soon as my dad saw what I was doing, he tried to "help"
<+Makkavelli> His version of "help" was to burn through the fucking laser cable
<+Makkavelli> with the soldering iron
<+Makkavelli> Son of a bitch
