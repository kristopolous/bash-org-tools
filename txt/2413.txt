<myhero> I think this is what I wanted to say, or something like this
<myhero> how about making a holiday the opposite of thanksgiving
<myhero> where your a bitch and hate everything in the world for one day
<myhero> that's what I did today
<myhero> it felt great
<Tik-Tok> that doesn't need to be a holiday
<Tik-Tok> most people are like that day to day
<myhero> yeah maybe
<myhero> well on this holiday, how about people try just a little bit harder to hate people
<myhero> ya know, in the spirit of the holiday
<myhero> hate people a little bit more
