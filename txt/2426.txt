* Silkenray eats a burnt cookie
<Silkenray> I'll pretend I didn't just clean up the eviscerated remains of my mother's used feminine hygeine products which my puppy distributed around the house.
<JDigital> Are you sure that was a cookie? >_<
<Silkenray> I know it was a cookie.
<Silkenray> My mother just baked it.
<JDigital> ...or pulled it out of her panties! Can you really be sure?
