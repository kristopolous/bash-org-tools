<noam`wm> I was studying Physics, right. Magnetic fields. There was a drawing in the book to demonstrate how the direction of the field is always orthogonal to the direction of the force. to do that, they drew a dot, 4 vectors of field and 4 directions of force, orthogonal to them.
<noam`wm> I painted the background in red and added SIEG HEIL.
