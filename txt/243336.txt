<spectre> hypno: did you see what braingrind wrote in the front of the book ?
<spectre> "Yo Fran. I liked this book. I pissed myself. You should like it too. If you don't, I can only assume you suck. Shizzle. Braingrind"
<bluecgi> haha what he wrote is like his account of a normal day
<bluecgi> he wakes up, says something, soils himself, emotes, soils himself again
