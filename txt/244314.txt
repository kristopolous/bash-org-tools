<Lord_Nuke> Blegh, today was annoying
<Lord_Nuke> Some people I wonder how they remember to get dressed mornings
<l33t-mercury> how so?
<Lord_Nuke> Well, as you know, I work at the Best Buy Rebate Center
<Lord_Nuke> So a woman calls in, she got a letter declining her rebate request for invalid receipt
<Lord_Nuke> it turns out she bought her computer at Comp-Usa, and then went on bestbuy.com and printed off a rebate form
<Lord_Nuke> And she wonders why she didn't get her rebate
<l33t-mercury> OMG! Rofl!
<Lord_Nuke> Yeah, well, its still better than the fool who forgets to mail it in at all
<Lord_Nuke> Customer: "Hi, I'd like to check on my rebate. I've been waiting 6 months"
<Lord_Nuke> Me: "Well, do you have a copy of your rebate form with you?"
<Lord_Nuke> Customer: "Yeah, let me open my envelope here, I have the rebate form."
<Lord_Nuke> Me: "Wait, wait. You have the envelope there? As in you didn't mail it?"
<Lord_Nuke> Customer: "Yeah, it's right here. Can you tell me what's taking so long?"
<l33t-mercury> lol
<Lord_Nuke> Me: "Just let me confirm this: You didn't mail it in, and you want to know what's taking so long?"
<Lord_Nuke> Customer: "Yes, that's correct..... oh. Shit." *click*
<l33t-mercury> haha
