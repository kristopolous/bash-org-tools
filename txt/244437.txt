<sweendOGgRH07> One year Dad decided he was going to take us on a "surprise vacation." We wouldn't know where we were going until we got there. We were all real excited when we piled into the station wagon early one morning. We went about five blocks, then we got in an accident at a four-way stop. I guess it was a
pretty good surprise, but why did we need all that camping gear?
<gamgames> hahaha
<sweendOGgRH07> I understand that Scissors can beat Paper, and I get how Rock can beat Scissors, but there's no fucking way Paper can beat Rock. Paper is supposed to magically "wrap around" Rock, leaving it immobile? Why the hell cant paper do this to scissors? Screw scissors, why can't paper do this to people? Why
aren't sheets of college ruled notebook paper constantly suffocating students as they attempt to take notes in class? I'll tell you why,because paper can't beat anybody a rock would tear that shit up in about 2 seconds.
<sweendOGgRH07> When I play rock/paper/scissors I always choose rock.Then when somebody claims to have beaten me with their paper I can punch them in the face with my already clenched fist and say Oh shit, I'm sorry I thought paper would protect you Asshole
