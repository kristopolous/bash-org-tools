<Namen> Who is peer and why is he running around the net resetting connections?
<Inquisitor> Peer is a drunkard who beats his kids and resets connections because his inability to retain fluids, more specifically of an urinal nature, prevents him from remaining dry for more than 20 minutes, causing him much ridicule and disdain.  This is a frustration which has scarred him, and some accounts
inform that he has been seen wading on his own pool of piss screaming "I AM NO BEDWETTER I AM NO BEDWETTER".
