<GameSlt> I just got back from new york/canada
<GinandPlatonic> rad, and how was new york/canada?
<GameSlt> it was ok...went river rafting which was cooler than one would think
<GameSlt> my mom fell out...was funny.
<GinandPlatonic> oh heh...this river rafting, does it have multiplayer support?
<GameSlt> up to 8 players I think
<GameSlt> and a great frame rate
<GinandPlatonic>: oh, hmm...
<GinandPlatonic>: What about "camping whores"?
<GameSlt>: they are called rocks...the bastards
<GameSlt>: I "ownz" them
