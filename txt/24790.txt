<mike> you should add something to the "add quote" page
<mike> something like "remember, your quote may or may not be approved because THE QUOTE DATABASE IS MODERATED BY HUMANS."
<RainWind> lol
<mike> i was serious
<Guilty> You should see how many people email me asking why I didnt approve their awful quotes
<Guilty> Like "HEY I submitted a 14 page long chat log and I dont see it added yet!"
<Guilty> Or "Whats the deal I submitted myself mentioning that I wanted to be in the QDB, and its not on there!"
