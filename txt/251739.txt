<Null> So I downloaded the O'Reilly bookshelf set on cd
<Null> Then I couldn't mount the iso
<Null> Out of curiosity I ran file on it and found out it was a Divx 3 file
<Null> So apparently my O'Reilly bookshelf iso set is softcore porn
<Null> I'd hate to be the guy who downloaded porn and got my bookshelf set
<Calidore> Well, now he can improve himself while downloading porn.
<Calidore> You, on the other hand, can look for the books one-handed.
