<bullava> I was watching Conan one night and there was a scottish guy on and he was saying that the original kilts where used as a sleeping bag as well as clothing .... and that since the kilt was so heavy scottish warriors would take it off and run into battle butt naked
<BraveFencer> Makes sense.  Exit the world the samre way you entered.  Naked and screaming.
<bullava> and plus whats more scarier seeing a man painted blue and butt naked running at you
<BraveFencer> The above, only with an erection and a bottle of lube in one hand.
