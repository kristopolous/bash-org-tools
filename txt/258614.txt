<Iyouboushi> hm.. personally, if it was me.. I'd be more worried about finding Kouga (who has 2 shards in his legs) and Kohaku (who has a shard in his back)
<Iyouboushi> I'd get the two shards from Kouga and take them to the modern times
<Iyouboushi> that way Naraku couldn't complete the jewel
<Iyouboushi> because you know once he has the jewel from the "after-life" place, he's immedately going to kill Kouga and Kohaku
<Rowen_Hashiba> man i can't breathe... too much geek in here, it's affecting my sinuses
