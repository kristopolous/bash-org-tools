<Ikaruwa> if i ever had to fire someone, i would do it scavenger hunt style. you know, give them a piece of paper with a riddle on it...
<Ikaruwa> and then when they figure out the riddle, itd point them towards the next piece of paper with a riddle on it...
<Ikaruwa> and keep doing that until theyve collected all their things and walked out the door. after which, theyd find a piece of paper under a rock that said "youre fired."
