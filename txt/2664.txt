<DTOX> I just spent 20 min arguing with the manager at McDonalds that I gave him a $20 instead of the $10 they thought I gave them.  Finally he gives me a $10 back + change and I go home and find out it really was a $10 I gave them and I'm an asshole.
<DTOX> I drove back and apologized and gave them back the $10 they gave me
<CoMBo> stick it to the man
<DTOX> combo:  I have a fucking job, I don't need to lie at McDonalds to make money you lazy fucking raft nigger
