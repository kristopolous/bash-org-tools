<Ouroboros> You know, I think the modern-day computer tech replaces, to some extent, the mystic of ancient times.
<Ouroboros> Here we have these strange, inexplicable boxes that are sometimes possessed by demons, and the mystic comes and opens the sacred box and waves his magic charms and things and somehow exorcises the spirits and makes everything good and whole again.
<Ouroboros> Then he takes all your money and disappears.
