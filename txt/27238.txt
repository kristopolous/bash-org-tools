<Staberinde> Ah lovely.  First I get Hirsuite women spam mail now I get "Anal breakfast fisting" spam mail
<Boogaleeboo> Eh.
<Boogaleeboo> "Do you like gay fisting?" still tops it for me
<Boogaleeboo> Not because it is so out there, but because it's really a blow to the ego for three seconds
<Boogaleeboo> Before you think "Hey, they don't know who the fuck I am"
<Staberinde> What I love is getting 2 viagra spam mails surrounded by spam mail for car loans or home loans
<Staberinde> Apparently they think that I can't get a loan and it's making me impotent
