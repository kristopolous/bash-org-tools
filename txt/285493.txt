<Kyr> When i was in psychiatry it was so funny when the psychologist tried to make me do this Rorschach test.  I said "that's a Rorschach test innit?" and he was like "yeah but you're not supposed to know that.  Now the test 'll be useless"
<Kyr> So I said the drawings looked like dead people and vaginas to console the guy.
