<tate> has anyone played this Amercan's Army game?
<Beerman> nope
<Goonigoogoo> I've read about it, but never downloaded it
<Beerman> I wonder if you can mod it
<Beerman> "talibans army"
<Beerman> that would be a fun game
<tate> yeah, and you can throw rocks, and mail Anthrax
<tate> and hide in caves
