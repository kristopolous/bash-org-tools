<Jumper> there's an old saying in this part of ze world: you're not a real geek until you've scored sex through IRC
<Jumper> irl sex, that is
<smiler> Jumper: We figured =)
<smiler> Jumper: can you even say you scored if you get cybersex?
<smiler> Jumper: That would be a REAL geek.
<Jumper> smiler: that would just be a looser
