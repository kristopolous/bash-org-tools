<Katalyst> how the hell do they make rice krispies snap crackle and pop
<SumDumGoy> Magic, Kat.
<Promethius> Kat: They over-dry the rice after it's puffed, so when milk touches it, it converts to a less-dense form and the act of subfusion makes it pop
<Katalyst> [Promethius]: the 'magic' idea seems less complicated :o
