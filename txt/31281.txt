<MechaRedMage> My Geography teacher told it to me... He was in mexico last year walking through an alley. Then three mexican guys jumped him and asked for his money. So he gave them his money ($.35) and then they looked at him and one guy pulled out a dollar and gave it to him saying "You need this more then we do."
