<D4NG3R0U5> why is it, in the commercials the bottles of medicine stop talking when the actor picks them up?
<D4NG3R0U5> usually when i pick up my med bottles they keep talkin "2 a day? what are you, a pussy! take 6!" "it says don't drink alcohol after taking me...you gonna let them tell you what to do?"
