<Sk8rDiE>  So I was trying to get up the bleachers,
<Sk8rDiE>  And this real ugly filipino girl wouldn't move
<Icarus>  heh
<Sk8rDiE>  So I'm like "'scuse me"
<Sk8rDiE>  and she just sits there, staring.
<Sk8rDiE>  So i was like "Bitch, Don't make me bust out the ethnic slurs!"
<Icarus>  ahahahahahaha
<Sk8rDiE>  I don't think she understood the dialect.
