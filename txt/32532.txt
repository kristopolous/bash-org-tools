<[SA]Gaijinchi> I was ripped as a kid.  When my friends wanted to go somewhere on bikes, I ran and kept up
<[SA]Gaijinchi> Then I turned 16 and promptly got out of shape
<ricequeen> Yeah, masturbation got me too
<[SA]Gaijinchi> You can masturbate and drive at the same time?
<[SA]Gaijinchi> That's incredible.
<ricequeen> It's an okay substitute for road head
<[SA]Gaijinchi> that's all kinds of dangerous.  I mean, what if you hit a bump or something?
<hoe4damoney> Just get a crash test dummy to fellate you
<hoe4damoney> its safer
<ricequeen> I call it, "Living on the edge"
