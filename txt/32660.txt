<pyroman> I am unilateraly discontinuing diplomatic relations with hexbit.
<hexbit> we had diplomatic relations?
<pyroman> I don't need tsalmavet's or anyones support, I prepared to take action alone if necessary.  pyroman can not just sit back and let someone like hexbit continue to harbor weapons of mass stupidity, and do nothing.
