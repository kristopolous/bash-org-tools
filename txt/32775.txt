<dranyam> It's nature. How do you make nature against the fucking law? It grows everywhere. Serves a thousand different functions, all of them positive. To make marijuana against the law is like saying to God made a mistake. You know what I mean, it's like God on the seventh day looked down on his creation:
<dranyam> "There it is, my creation, perfect and holy in all ways. Now, I can rest."
<dranyam> [Mimes God looking around - spotting pot]
<dranyam> "Oh my me."
<dranyam> "I left fucking pot everywhere."
<dranyam> "I should never have smoked that joint on the third day ..shit."
<dranyam> "That was the day I created possums. Haha. Still gives me a chuckle."
<dranyam> "If I leave pot everywhere that's gonna to give humans the impression they're supposed to... 'use' it."
<dranyam> "(sigh)Now I have to create Republicans."
