This is during a joke where 2-D is acting Japanese in another room
<The_2-D> He said ditto to me, and I said ditto is japanese for truck
<Ten> AHAHAHA
<Ten> TRUCK
<The_2-D> So he will go through the rest of his life telling people ditto is Japanese for truck.
<Ten> lets hope so
<The_2-D> And on my death bed, someone will end up using the word ditto, and someone around my bed will say, "that's Japanese for truck."
<Ten> AHAHAHAHA
<Ten> youll die laughing
<Ten> and no one will know why
