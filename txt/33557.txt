<pmitros> In Europe, is the convention 100C or 100 [little 0 degree symbol] C for expressing temperature?
<st2> pmitros: That can lead to a lot of confusion
<pmitros> st2: What do you mean?
<st2> pmitros: "Bake your turkey at 800C for 20min"
* RelDrgn notes that nobody bakes turkey at 800dF either :P
<pmitros> st2: I'm wondering if you include the little superscript o. No. It'd be a little bit cooler.
<pmitros> In LaTeX format, is it 100C or 100^oC?
<st2> 100$^o$C
<TigerSun> I'd bake Cyprus ar 2000C
