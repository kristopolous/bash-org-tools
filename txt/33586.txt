<daenonok> i remember this one time, like two years ago my girlfriend (at the time) was trying to learn me...somethen, i wasn't really paying attention, but she said
<daenonok> 'if barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours'
<daenonok> after like a minute of thinking i was like 'that seems like icing on the cake'
