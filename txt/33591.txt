<Sketchee> Ok.  How does the game connection work?
<Grandalf> im guessing tcp/ip
<Grandalf> though it dosen't say anywhere
<Grandalf> but we both have ipx installed so we can play atomic bomberman, so that shoulden't be the problem either
<Sketchee> Okay, and then when you two try to connect together ... ?
<Grandalf> on the "find game" screen it dosen't find crap.
<Grandalf> though there are games running
<Grandalf> and yes, we have the same version
<Grandalf> it's a mystery ;P
<Sketchee> Is there any documentation for this game?
<Grandalf> probably if i bought it ....
