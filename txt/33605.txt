<tate> it occurs to me
<Beerman> myeas?
<tate> and this is really probably not a good thought
<Beerman> ooh
<tate> but if a man were to buy those crazy "enhance your bust line" pills and sneak them into his girlfriend/wife's food, would they still work the same?
<Fenris> Yes they do

<tate> the next question, of course, is do those pills work at all?
<Fenris> Yes
* Fenris caresses his monster jugs
<Fenris> NEVERMIND THAT
