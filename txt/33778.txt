<Hatamoto> I'd like to make 2 comments of public interest:
<Hatamoto> #1 - Barium contrast substrate tastes like a day-old mcdonalds strawberry milkshake with tums ground up in it. Eech. The little lemon-lime 'fizzy pills' you gotta swallow taste like ass too.
<Hatamoto> #2 - Hospital robes are way too fucking small.
<Hatamoto> ... thank you.
<Hatamoto> Oh yes, and one more thing:
<Hatamoto> #3 - Barium burps. The gift that just keeps on giving.
