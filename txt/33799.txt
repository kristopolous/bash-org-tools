<RichiH> talking of netBSD - someone has a spare toaster to test 1.6?
<mirabile> lol toaster
<mirabile> you know them :)
<RichiH> you just wait...
<RichiH> some day they will support toasters and washing machines
<Tschechow> "a toaster can be on or off, so it has at least one bit, so netbsd should boot on it."
* RichiH 's mental eye sees a toaster's heating elements glow morse code
<mirabile> lol
<zinx> they already do, you just need the right brand
<RichiH> or it could punch the toast
