<pthree_> oh, my stupid t1 is having issues
* RichiH asks himself if having a private T1 is the heigth of geekdomn, or if it is the ultimate of saying "i got no rl friends"
<Seker> RichiH: It'll be the height of geekdom if you max it out with warez.
<RichiH> Seker: if you max it out with warez, it's a way of saying "i am 13, have no friends, use windows and need a good poke in the eyes. besides, i got no firends, neither rl nor vr"
