<active1> how to become a bot ???
<dieppiej> first you have to become a computer, then you have to get an 24/7 internet connection and plug it into yourself.. install a stable *BSD OS and then install the right application on yourself
<active1> it is so easy :))))
<dieppiej> I wonder how you are going to do the first step..
