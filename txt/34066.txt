<SenorWeird> ugh. I need help
<Duckie5147> with what?
<SenorWeird> I got to the end of a page in this novel i'm reading and I hit the "page down" button on my keyboard.
<Duckie5147> hahaha
<Duckie5147> you need to read things not one the screen
<SenorWeird>  and when the page didn't turn, I got pissed and grabbed the mouse and was like where's the damn scroll bar"
<SenorWeird>  and then I realized...."you're reading a book. let the mouse go."
