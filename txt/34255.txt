<PSlagle-Tech> you should have seen me explaining the concept of drivers to my mother when I was setting up their computer... I explained it like this...
* JamesR-Tech covers his eyes
<JP_Tech> this could be interesting
<PSlagle-Tech> "Imagine you woke up one morning with a third arm... you wouldn't know how to control it, right? So you get a book and read how to control it, and then you can use it."
* JamesR-Tech copies and pastes to bash.org
<PSlagle-Tech> trhe arm is the modem, and the book is the driver.
<JP_Tech> lol
<PSlagle-Tech> hey... she understood after that. :)
