<Mango> Haha, I went to the bathroom, came out, and ripped off a piece of sweet bread that was on the table and my dad says "What the hell are you doing? Did you wash your hands?"
<Mango> I said "no, but I didnt piss on my hands so dont worry"
<Mango> "doesnt matter" he says "your hands were still all over your dick"
<Mango> "Who cares? My dick, along with my entire body, came out of YOUR dick"
<Mango> So now we can't look eachother in the eyes anymore.
