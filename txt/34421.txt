KoG_Work> God damn it... "the westbound backup to the toll plaza is horrible! west 80 is slow from central, 580 jams up from lakeshore, and north 880 is slow from the grand avenue curve. the metering lights are on, and traffic on the upper deck is slow from the incline into san francisco" ~_~
* KoG_Work ponders taking the 92...
<KoG_Work> if it's backed up to lakeshore, can't even make a detour to Ikea like I normally do!
<St0rmD> you go to the furniture store so much you have detours and shortcuts to get there?
<DishHole> maybe ikea has a drive-through
