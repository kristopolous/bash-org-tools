<@toe2toe> only time a user has ever cried with me was when she had zonealarm set to ultra-annoy-user-at-every-oppurtunity mode on
<@toe2toe> and basically, her nortons was so locked down
<@toe2toe> everytime she tried to get her mail
<@toe2toe> and our server tried to send it to her
<@toe2toe> she thought she was getting hacked
<@Starfire> the best option i have found in ZA configs is the uninstall one
<@toe2toe> and when i told her she wasnt, she thought that some people are harrasing her, and demanded to know why i refused to call the police about it :>
<@Starfire> because its not your job to call the police
<@Starfire> i would have given her police number
<@Starfire> and told her to follow it up post haste!
<@toe2toe> and say what
<@toe2toe> "hi, im getting hacked on my computer from a guy called "local host"
