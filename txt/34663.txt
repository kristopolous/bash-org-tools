<RushMore> Shit, i was in physics and near shit myself
<RushMore> THe place went black, and i thought i crashed
<RushMore> THEN a light came on, and i saw a ball dropping, but it was only at like 8fps
<RushMore> I thought "Shit, i need a new graphics card"
<RushMore> Then i found out, the teacher turned out all the lights, put on a strobe light at 8flashes/s and dropped a ball so you could see its accelleration
<RushMore> Dickhead.
