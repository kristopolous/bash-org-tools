<Squatter> Liking Russians is one of those neutral things that doesn't say anything about someone
<Lush> Yes it does
<Lush> After Khaled told his friends about me, they all wrote to say that Russians are fabulous in the general vicinity of the bedroom
<Lush> I didn't know whether or not to be offended, so I just smiled politely
<Squatter> Really? I never heard that. Normally I think first and foremost of the arts, then brutally oppressive government
<Lush> I think the former does not contadict the statement about bedrooms
<Squatter> Neither does the latter
