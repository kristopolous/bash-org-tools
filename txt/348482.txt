<HEIST> I hate early am with no sleep. I hear the voices inside my head..
<HEIST> The flashbacks.. the urges..
<HEIST> Like I'm dropping down a well into a pit of something..
<HEIST> I can LITERALLY hear voices whispering in my ears
<HEIST> saying things
<HEIST> wicked things
<HEIST> telling me what to do
<Vortex> what are they saying now?
<HEIST> "drink more ovaltine"
