<Zero_Flaw> Wow, I just saw my dad surfing the net looking at health sites about STD's. No wonder he was trying to shield the computer screen from me. But, I could still see Herpes at the top left.
<Zero_Flaw> Even worse, 5 minutes later my mom gets on the computer and looks at the same thing.
<Zero_Flaw> I should have been a bastard and said, "Mom, you don't look like you're feeling too well, something wrong?"
