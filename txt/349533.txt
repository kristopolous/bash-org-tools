<Immortal> A friend of mine works as a janitor at a high school
<Immortal> and that high school has a really advanced mental/developmentally handicapped program
<Immortal> in other words, a special wing for retards
<wm161> dyslexics of the world, untie!
<Patrick_Moore> lol
<Immortal> well anyway, the janitors put mousetraps in the rooms that the retards use
<Immortal> but the retards kept setting them off to take the peanut butter
<Immortal> eventually, they figured out that they could set them off with a foot and it would hurt less
<Immortal> so they had to hide the mouse traps
<Immortal> :D
<Immortal> anyone who reads all that will think it's funny
<Immortal> or else call me an insensitive bastard
