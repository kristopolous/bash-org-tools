<GLE> Does eating a chunk of cheese rolled in sandwich meat make me a fatass?
<JimiThing> im inclined to say yes
<JimiThing> but depends on the size and type of cheese
<JimiThing> and the kind of meat
<GLE> Sunrise thin-sliced turkey, and old cheddar cheese with a volume of about... 5 cm^3?
<Phil_> Nah... but I'm pretty sure figuring out the volume of a piece of cheese makes you a virgin.
