<Shiv>
<Shiv>It has been several months since I was banned from the ANBU forums, and I believe that I have <Shiv>learned my lesson.  I promise to never, ever again ask for the specifics regarding what has <Shiv>infested your colon, nor if said infestation has begun the laying of eggs.  If you wish, I <Shiv>will avoid the
subject of your intestinal invaders altogether.
<Shiv>
<Shiv>Additionally, I withdraw my query regarding the status of your Valtrex prescription.  <Shiv>Understandably, I am sure this would be an uncomforatable subject to speak of to a stranger.
<Shiv>
<Shiv>With great expectations and rock hard nipples, I await your reply.  Thank you.
