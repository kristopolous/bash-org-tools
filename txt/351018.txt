<MalachiConstant> hah, I have a funny story about watching Ringu, ready?
<Jessica> Yeah.
<MalachiConstant> I was watching it on DVD, and it was a quiet scene, like s shot of someone sleeping...
<MalachiConstant> I was admiring how they kept showing someone just sleeping, and were realy building the tension well...
<MalachiConstant> then I realized my DVD player was stuck and I was watching a still frame for about 10 minutes on the edge of my seat
