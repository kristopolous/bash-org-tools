<@koenig> I just had a very fun time with a telemarketer who called my home.
<@koenig> She was telling me that I had "won in a drawing" and that I might have won a Hummer or a trip to Orlando and some other crap.
<@koenig> So I said, "Hey, them Hummers is sure nice."
<@koenig> "Oh yes," she replies.
<@koenig> "I bet they can haul a lot in them Hummers."
<@koenig> "Oh certainly."
<@koenig> "Do you think they could hold something that was like 6' long?"
<@koenig> "Most likely."
<@koenig> "And weighed like 150-200 lbs.?"
<@albus> oh dear.
<@koenig> "Possibly."
<@koenig> "Well, I'll cut right to hte chase.  Do you think they could carry a dead body?"
<@koenig> "Uhhhh."
* albus hears police sirens.
<@koenig> :)
<@albus> you should use her as a reference when you apply for a security clearance.
<@koenig> Well you realize I didn't actually claim to HAVE a dead body.   I was purely curious, in case I get into the funeral service business.
<@koenig> It's my new idea, "Die With Style, Inc." where instead of a hearse you drive out in a Hummer.
<@albus> ...
