<Andy> sorry about leaving abruptly before :) the ice cream van went past the house and then the power went out :)
<speice> what the Ice-cream van took out the power line??
<UFO6> nah, the rush of overweight kids to the van?
<Andy> Hehe ;)
<UFO6> i saw a kid put a dent into a car from running into it once...
<UFO6> man, you would think his head was rubber from the way he bounced off.
