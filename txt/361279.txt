<Animaga> so, there's this panda bear
<Animaga> and he walks into Pizza Hut, orders some pizza, and sits down
<Animaga> once he's done eating, he takes a look at the bill and just goes to walk out
<Animaga> manager and server try to stop him, saying "you have to pay for your food"
<Animaga> so he pulls out a gun and shoots the place up
<Animaga> the workers are terrified, asking him what the hell he's doing
<Animaga> he hands them a dictionary, and turns the page to "panda bear"
<Animaga> it says "small black and white bear, native to asia.  eats shoots and leaves."
