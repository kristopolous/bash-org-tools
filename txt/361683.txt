<Fire_Elemental-x-> Interviews suck in general
<apathy> I dunno...
<apathy> I used to like conducting them :)
<Fire_Elemental-x-> all that "where do you see yourself in 10 years" and "what are your strengths and weaknesses" crap
<apathy> heh, my questions were more along the lines of "tell me everything you know about the keyword 'const'"
<Fire_Elemental-x-> Next time someone asks me a 10 years question I'm gonna say "Where you are sitting"
<apathy> heh, then add "No wait, I thought you said 10 months."
<Fire_Elemental-x-> heh
