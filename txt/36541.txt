<DiamonDie> dutch people can't be named ben.
<bool> DiamonDie, why not?
<DiamonDie> because they can't!
<bool> they did!
<bool> even a mobile phone company is called Ben
<DiamonDie> so you're a mobile phone, too?
<DiamonDie> it would be quite odd to be a mobile phone. you'd get fingered all the time.
