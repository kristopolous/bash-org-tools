<mightyflo> i still want the milli vanilli cd
<mightyflo> the only place i've seen it is a smoky as hell pool hall
<scummo> Dr Q's.
<scummo> I go there specifically to play that entire CD all the time!!!
<scummo> And the best part is, all the people there never get that I was the one who put it on
<scummo> So they always strike up conversation like "Haha.. I wonder who the faggot who put this shit on was.."
<scummo> especially when I had the whole long-haired rocker image
