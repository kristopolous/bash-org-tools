<MidWay> Sounds like me writing a page that had the WinXP logout exploit..
<MidWay> Friend set it to his desktop before I'd added it (It did actually have content)
<MidWay> So the next time he logged in and it updated, boom, it logged him out.
<MidWay> Problem was, he only had the one account on the machine :P
