<bahumat1> my mother is a cleaning fanatic
<bahumat1> one Saturday she told me and my brother to get down to the playroom and straighten it up
<bahumat1> we had a party there the previous evening, and she was none too happy about the mess
<bahumat1> as she watched us work, it was clear that Mom was completely dissatisfied with our cleaning efforts and let us know it
<bahumat1> Finally my brother, exasperated with having to do it all over, reached for a broom and asked Mom:
<bahumat1> can I use this, or were you planning to go somewhere?
