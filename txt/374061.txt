<mojo1701> I remember being in class, and the teacher started talking to us about communicable diseases
<mojo1701> our teacher's a real whore
<mojo1701> and she kept on saying to us: "Flies can carry diseases. You don't know where they've been"
<mojo1701> and I looked at her and said, "Then you should stop unzipping so many of them if you don't know where they've been."
