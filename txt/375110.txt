<DAMNIT> My god I hate being new clerk at the pharmacy where I work...
<DAMNIT> Today some 80 year old guy comes in with a giant syringe, asking if we had it.
<DAMNIT> The guy handed me it, I took it in my hand, and I looked in every part of the store possible cause I had no clue in hell what it was.
<DAMNIT> So, I go in back and ask the owner if we have it or can order it, still holding it in my hand.
<DAMNIT> The owner then bursts out laughing and point at me, so I go "What's so funny? The guy just wants to order it?"
<DAMNIT> So the owner goes "That's a enema syringe. It's probally been up his ass plenty of times by the color of it!"
<DAMNIT> I then procede to calmly walk back to the front, give the guy his anal sucker back, and the owner then deals with him about ordering it.
<DAMNIT> Meenwhile I put every soap we have on my hands and rub like hell for 20 minutes till my skin is completely raw.
<DAMNIT> And I'm the laughing stock of the store now, and 2 of my relatives work there, so soon my whole family will be laughing at me......
