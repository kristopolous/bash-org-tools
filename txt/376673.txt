<FLoYD>  CHILD: Dad, where did I come from?
<FLoYD>  DAD: Okay, we had to have this conversation some day!.. Listen........
<FLoYD>  Dad and mom met in a chat room on the net. I set up a meeting with
<FLoYD>  your mom and we landed in the bathroom at the Cyber Cafi. Then,
<FLoYD>  mom did some downloads from dads memory stick and when dad
<FLoYD>  was ready to upload, we discovered that there was no firewall. Seeing
<FLoYD>  that it was a bit too late to cancel, I just carried on doing the upload.
<FLoYD>  Nine months later, the virus appeared!.
<FLoYD>  CHILD: Huh?
