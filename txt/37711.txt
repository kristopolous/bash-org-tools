<me2> How do I queue a clip in server...everytime it says slot is available someone fills it in
<MrParker> did you use "get" or "queue" ?
<me2> queue, but others seem to beat me to the available slot
<me2> but I want to fill the slot
<me2> Ive been on top of the slot ready to fill it tho
<me2> I want to put it in
<me2> Well...once I get it in its staying there
<MrParker> are we still talking about files ??
