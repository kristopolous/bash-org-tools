<MiLordDemise> My foot is touching the cord for my keyboard
<MiLordDemise> and each time I press a button I can feel the electrical pulse go through the wires
<IntoMyShadows> Now that's something.
<MiLordDemise> Aye...
<MiLordDemise> I wish I could type a bit faster
<MiLordDemise> it makes my foot feel good and strange at the same time
<IntoMyShadows> Just hit random keys
<MiLordDemise> it's like a cord-thin massage
<MiLordDemise> wow
<MiLordDemise> I think I need some alone time with my keyboard now
<MiLordDemise> hehe
<IntoMyShadows> Maybe you should move the cord to another part of you
<MiLordDemise> I just might
<IntoMyShadows> you sick bastard.
<IntoMyShadows> I probably would, too
<MiLordDemise> You suggested it
<MiLordDemise> so that makes us both sick bastards
<MiLordDemise> go us!
