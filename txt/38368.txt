<mstyne> surprisingly, i feel okay
<mstyne> which is probably bad : )
<Etan> only if you tell your bosses, and get longer days
<mstyne> well, ordinarily i'd be wiped after 12 hours
<mstyne> but i'm not
<mstyne> i think they must put something in the water
<-- caffine has quit (Remote closed the connection)
<mstyne> aha, that answers it
<Etan> the guilt overpowered him
