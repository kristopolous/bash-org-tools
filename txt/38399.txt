<godofcows> I decided on some cool things I'm gonna do when I get rich
<godofcows> like ask my mom what car she would like the most, and then buy it
<godofcows> and then when she comes outside to look at it, it'll get run over by a monster truck
<godofcows> and she'll cry
<@godofcows> I thought of another thing I'd do if I ever got rich
<@godofcows> I'd gonna buy a bunch of toys for an orphanage
<@godofcows> and have them all laid out in front of the building on christmas morning and get someone who works there to wake up all the kids and come out to look
<@godofcows> and when they all step outside and look, I'm gonna run over the toys with a monster truck and laugh at the looks on their faces
