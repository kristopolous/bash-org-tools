<Murielle> this just in from ABC Radio - a man went to defend himself when he heard a noise, stuck a .22 caliber pistol in his shorts..  accidently pulled the hammer back...  felt this stinging sensation, and a trickle of blood down his leg....
<Murielle> he had performed a self-orchectomy
<Murielle> :-)
<Noelle> lol
<Charron> hmm, so shooting your testes off "stings"?
<Murielle> apparently
<StephanieNYC> uhhhh
<StephanieNYC> a stinging sensation?
<StephanieNYC> this makes for a new definition to the term "numb nuts"
