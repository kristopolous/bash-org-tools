<27946889> hola.
<Losifer> Do I know you?
<27946889> No, I found you on random chat.
<27946889> What, just because you don't know someone you won't talk to them?
<Losifer> Pretty much.  This is my work account.  I conduct business through this account.  I don't have time to chat.
<27946889> Sorry.
<27946889> i think you're very rude
<Losifer> That's interesting.  I find it more rude to continue to send unsolicited messages to a stranger once you've been told that the stranger in question isn't interested in talking to you.
<27946889> why are you in such a bad mood, you are so young, sorry that i thought it would be nice to talk to you because i saw your info and i found you interesting,,,
<Losifer> I'm in a bad mood because I'm working and you keep interrupting me.  Please go away.
<27946889> so where do you work?
<27946889> let me ask you something, how come it says satan ate your ears in your info?
