<Match> eyeglass repair kits are so retarded
<H4Z3> how so?
<Match> if someone needs to fix their glasses, then obviously they cant see too well. if they know this, why would they make them so fucking small and hard to find?
<H4Z3> umm... cuz then it would be a normal screwdriver
<Match> thats not what i mean. i know that they have to be small, but why cant they make them more visible. like packaging them in bright red
<Match> or putting one of those things on them that when you clap it beeps
<H4Z3> cuz that would seem equally retarded. just imagine someone walking around their house, squinting and claping repeatedly.
<H4Z3> 'what the hell are you doing?'  'Oh, I just need to fix my glasses.'
