<ANonRhymingNick> Messed my english teacher up friday when we were writing that essay..
<ANonRhymingNick> She was like "what school did you come from?" "Live Oak." "Ahh..That's why you don't have a problem with this kind of stuff." "No, I don't have a problem with this stuff because I got most of my education outside of Louisiana" "*silence*"
