<JDigital> Hacking dates back to early Roman times. However, back then there was very little to 'hack' - only stone tablets.
<JDigital> People who would sneak in at night and change the contents of a stone tablet by 'hacking' at it with a hammer and chisel... hence the name, 'hacker'.
<JDigital> Those who did only damage were known as 'crackers', since they'd just run in a smash the stone tablets.
