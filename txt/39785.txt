<Haunter> Some ultra-Christian girl said "Jesus loves you" to me today, and I said "Just me?"  She said, "No, he loves everyone."  So I collapsed in fake tears and started wailing, yelling "What kind of a healthy relationship is THAT supposed to be?  I gave 15 years of my life to that man, and he's going around loving
EVERYONE?"
