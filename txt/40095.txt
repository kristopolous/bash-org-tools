<Alwyn Aldarion> X are you deaf or what ?
<MegamanX2K> Yes. Yes, I am deaf. This makes it IMPOSSIBLE for me to read anything written on screen, because I have trained a parrot to read whatever is on my screen so I can browse the web while at the same time spying on the cute girl next door while she's changing AND her equally cute sister who is also changing
AT THE SAME TIME. So, yes, I was unable to hear your enlightening post. I apologize.
