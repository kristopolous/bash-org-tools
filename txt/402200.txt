<oobey> my school year is off to a great start
<oobey> I was in the back of my physics auditorium, trying not to fall completely asleep. The professor asks a question about what method we use when doing math in science, so to pretend like I'm not falling alseep, I shout out "sig figs"
<oobey> I then open my eyes and realize the prof is currently talking about vectors and scalars, so the question was dreamed, but the answer was not, and the entire class has come to a complete stop now
<oobey> at this point I'm at a loss as to what to do, so I pick up my bag and walk out without saying another word
