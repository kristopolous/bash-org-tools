<DrNick668> man, a volvo hit me yesterday
<DrNick668> the volvo hit me and it's gunna cost me like 200 bucks or some shit coz it was my fault
<Warkha> was it an old person in the volvo?
<DrNick668> nah, fat chick
<DrNick668> i turned across the traffic and couldn't see her comin
<Prozzy> at least the fat chick didn't hit on you, you woulda had to pay another $200 to make her go away
<Warkha> or throw food
