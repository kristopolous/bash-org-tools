<Sigma> shit, there is no way I'm going to a public vigil tonight
<Sigma> public crying and weeping does nothing for me
<Sigma> but I know someone will rope me into going
<Kevyn> Public vigil? Fuck that, I'm going to the strip club.
<Sigma> Kev: do your patriotic duty
<Sigma> don't let the terrorists win
<waffle> Kevyn: everyone has to remember in their own way, BRAVO!
<Kevyn> Word.
<Kevyn> I'll build a NEW tower.
<Kevyn> IN MY PANTS!
