<Jermsnap> Seen the new projector cell phones? they project their screen on the ground or a wall with lasers, up to a 20inch "screen"
<danno> that sounds incredibly useless
<Jermsnap> not at all, those screens are tiny, cant really do shit on em, now thats solved, also I believe it will make humans LOOK more futuristic.
<danno> oOOOoh...
<danno> it would make a little more sense to see that on a PDA...
<Jermsnap> PDA phones, same thing soon
<Jermsnap> I dont have a cell phone, but if I could project stuff on stuff, Id get one :)
<Jermsnap> PDA's are usaeless to a loner like me, dun work, no friends, what the hell would I put on there?
<danno> then what would you need a damn cellphone for?
<Jermsnap> hmmm... good point
<Jermsnap> :(
