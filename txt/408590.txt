BillyLove:  Half awake, some of my large mammal friends and I are sitting around playing Scatergories at around 1 AM.

BillLove:  Right before we got the letter H and "People who work at night", we got W and "Female athletes", then someone yells out "WHO CARES?" That's the last time we play that late.
