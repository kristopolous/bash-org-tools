<CommanderStab> Lee (Bleeding) had this cool-sounding lecturer once
<CommanderStab> They were in like some biology class or whatever and the guy was like
<CommanderStab> "Very few species partake in sex for pleasure. Can you think of some such species?"
<CommanderStab> So everyone is like, duh, humans
<CommanderStab> "Yes, exactly, humans! Humans are not bound by some mating pattern, they will often merely have sex just for the enjoyment of it!"
<Kaneda> ^^
<CommanderStab> "So, for example, if I was to ask this girl" (points to some girl in the first row) "if she would have sex with me, she would say yes"
<Tiger-Rik> lol ^^"
<CommanderStab> and the girl is like covering her face and everything =D
<CommanderStab> And then the dude waits for the laughter to die down and goes
<CommanderStab> "Of course, this is rare. Most of the time it is the GIRL who asks ME to have sex with THEM!"
<CommanderStab> He got an ovation =D
<Tiger-Rik> BWAHAHAHAHA
