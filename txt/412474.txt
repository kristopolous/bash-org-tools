<Georgo> bah, you stupid people and your big paragraphs, I always get the gist of things by reading the first and last sentences
<Piggah> Well Georgo, there was this one time me and your mom went out to the store. However, it ended up with my getting these sudden, primal urges.

<Georgo> god I love happy storys
