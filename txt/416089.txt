<<p3ps1c4n>> I just killed a bee that was flying around my kitchen.
<<sp0rkk>> omg, dude.. LOL!!
<<sp0rkk>> this one time, i caught a bee and put it in a cup inside the freezer..
<<sp0rkk>> and then i took it back out, and tied a string to it.. 'cause it was frozen so it wouldn't sting me..
<<sp0rkk>> and then it thawed out and came back to life.. so i was like "whee!", walking around..
<<sp0rkk>> and then the fucker started chasing me around, trying to sting me!
<<p3ps1c4n>> Rofl!
<<sp0rkk>> so i smashed it with a frozen block of bacon.
<<p3ps1c4n>> I fear for your cat.
<<sp0rkk>> dude, stfu.
