<@dev> I just shit out a "family" of logs.
<@dev> There were two huge ones.. 2 smaller ones. and a tiny one.
<@dev> And then I killed them when I flushed!
<@r3v|ShenL0ng-P-> lol
<@r3v|ShenL0ng-P-> was the tiny one the dog
<@dev> It might have been a baby.
<@r3v|DeathZero> did you poke it.. maybe it was a fetus
<@dev> I left it alone.
<@dev> :o
