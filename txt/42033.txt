<AutistiCat> Anyone know how to get a halogen light bulb to fit into a halogen lamp thing?
<Ochopatas> Push on it
<AutistiCat> It has two little things sticking out and they won't go in...
<AutistiCat> If I push any harder it'll break before it goes in.
<Sensi> you slide it in and rotate the light. it should lock in
<AutistiCat> It won't slide in. It's like the holes are too small.
<Squinky> Wait until it passes adolescence.
