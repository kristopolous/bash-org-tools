(CamelToe) did I ever tell you I have a CAT-5 outlet in my downstairs bathroom, so I can chat while I poo
(Q`) A friend of mine has a "pleestation"
(Q`) "plee" meaning bathroom
(Q`) It's a pc with fast internet connection, games etc... right in front of the toilet
(Q`) :-P
(CamelToe) so I guess if you're playing a game such as Undying, you can really scare the shit out of yourself
(Q`) Hahaha
