<+Nobody> Stephen Stack and James Gundlach were awarded the 2004 Ignobel Award for their paper The Effect of Country Music on Suicide that links the suicide rate to the amount of country music played on the radio
<+private_meta> hmm... if they would play country music in the radio i would commit suicide too... so whats so phenomenous on that paper?
