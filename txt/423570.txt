HitMan: have you ever played that game "Taboo" ?
Spanky: nope
Spanky: don't think I've ever heard of it
HitMan: oh, well there's teams of two people, and you have a card that has
a word on it, and you have to make your partner guess the word.  but
there's 5 words you're not allowed to say
Spanky: oh. it's like that stupid gameshow that used to be on a
million years ago
HitMan: so we were playing that tonight, and I was teamed with my buddy
Matt, and the word was "pornography" ... so first thing I say is "what you
masturbate to"
HitMan: he replies "Hillary Duff!"
