<@Phillip> so
<@Phillip> ive come up with a rough formula to calculate the chance that a chick at a bar will want to screw me
<@Phillip> C=[(p/t)/100]+100(D)
<@Phillip> C is the percentage chance that she will want to
<@Phillip> p is pi
<@Phillip> t is the amount of time in seconds that i talk
<@Phillip> and D is how drunk she is
