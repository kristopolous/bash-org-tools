<_chaos> The world will be perfect when you can log conversations from real life.
<_chaos> For example if a man denies sleeping with another woman his wife can just check the logs.
<_chaos> And the only way to cheat is if you had admin powers to edit the logs... like me. heh :)
<CCDude> or i could kick your nerdy ass and make you do it for me
<_chaos> Then you would be arrested after they checked the logs!
<CCDude> shit
<CCDude> your still a fucking nerd
<_chaos> And your still an idiot. :D
