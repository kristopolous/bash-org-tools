<@rsg_6100> i likew the fact that my monitors and my computer keep my room nice and toasty with out me having to use the heater
<@Hardedge> i think that has more to do with convection then radiation
<@rsg_6100> i can make popcorn from the radiation
<@Hardedge> yummy
<@Hardedge> well at least you can't have offspring
<@rsg_6100> naw i got some of the "boys" frozen in the freezer
