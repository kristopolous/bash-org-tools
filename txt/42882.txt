<Yhwh> I want my mp3s back :(
<Chris_A> Why don't you recreate them as MIDI in Mario Paint and then emulate the Mario Paint ROM and recreate said MIDI on your new PC!??!?!
<Yhwh> Didn't Mario Paint not have sharps and flats?
<Chris_A> That's your biggest concern about my plan?
<Yhwh> It is a pretty big concern!
