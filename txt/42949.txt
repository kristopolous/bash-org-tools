<static> there's one of those funny looking airconditioning fan thingies out side the mall nearby.  it blows air straight up out of the sidewalk.  I keep looking at it as I walk by and wondering "if I stand on it,  will it push me up to the second level of the mall?"
<static> I think I play too many video games.
<FJ> test it
<FJ> throw a cat into the stream
<FJ> at the vry least, you'll be laughing your butt off
