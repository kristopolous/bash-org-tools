Rabidplaybunny87: A Touching Story of Love and Marriage
Rabidplaybunny87: An elderly man lay dying in his bed. In death's agony, he suddenly
smelled  the aroma of his favorite chocolate chip cookies wafting up
the stairs.  He gathered his remaining strength, and lifted himself from
the bed.  Leaning against the wall, he slowly made his way out of the
bedroom, and with even greater effort inched himself down the stairs,
gripping the railing  with both hands.
Rabidplaybunny87: With labored breath, he leaned against the door frame, gazing into
the kitchen. Were it not for death's agony, he would have thought
himself already in heaven. There, spread out upon newspapers on
the kitchen table, were literally  hundreds of his favorite chocolate
chip cookies.
Rabidplaybunny87: Was it heaven? Or was  it one final act of heroic love from his devoted
wife, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man?  Mustering one
great final effort, he moved himself toward the table.  His parched lips
parted; the wondrous taste of the cookie was almost already in his mouth;
seemingly bringing him back to life.
Rabidplaybunny87: The aged and withered hand, shakily made its way to a cookie at
the edge of the table, when it was suddenly smacked with a spatula
by his wife.
Rabidplaybunny87: "Stay out of those," she said, "they're for the funeral."
