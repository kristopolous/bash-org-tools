<Dr.Jew> So im training to become technician/consumer sales representative and the instructor tells us we get to listen to a few of the most outrageous calls theyve recorded. He plays the first one and, I couldnt make this up, a guy calls in and is telling the rep that his mouse is all the way on the left edge of the
mousepad but he needs the pointer to go to the left some more. After about 15 minutes of nerdy laughter, he asks this kid what he would say in a situation like that and the kid says "Sir, based on my interpretation of the information you gave me, I suggest purchasing one of our larger mousepads.".
