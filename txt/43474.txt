<Firemoth> Anyone know how long a male bird will usually go out looking for food?
<milenko> Firemoth: spose it depends on what bird
<Firemoth> Plover.
<Firemoth> We've got a female bird here with 4 babies, the dad's been gone all day and hasn't come back yet.
<milenko> Firemoth: get the female to apply for social security
