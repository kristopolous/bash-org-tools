<JohnnyZZ> my friend use to put his cat in a pillowcase and throw it down the stairs when we were little. the cat's name was Oscar. i use to to call him Oscar the grouch, because he was grouchy a lot of the time.
<Padijun> Maybe he was grouchy because you fucking threw it down the stairs in a pillowcase, genius.
