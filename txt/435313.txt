<TheMaxx> interesting cash making tactic i've discovered in Rome: Total War
<TheMaxx> once a city starts getting really, really... big.. the citizens start getting a little uppity, especially if your city lacks certain amenities befitting a city of its size
<TheMaxx> so fine
<TheMaxx> remove the garrison, crank up the taxes and let them revolt
<TheMaxx> army moves back in with little opposition (peasants vs. legions, pshaw).. then execute 70% of the population and take their gold
<TheMaxx> before you know it they'll start clamouring for democracy
<Deltan> If there were a dictator of the year award, you'd be a shoe in.
<Deltan> That Saddam fellow has nothing on you.
