<PeppyTheHamster> me and my friends went to a local gas station on lunch at school to buy some snacks and shit.
<PeppyTheHamster> we got inside, and the guy behind the counter was like
<PeppyTheHamster> "Why arent you in school?"
<PeppyTheHamster> We told him we were on lunch and he was like "Good. stay in school, its good for you."
<PeppyTheHamster> I turned to him and said "Yeah! So we can work in a gas station!"
<PeppyTheHamster> He looked at me like I was the anti-christ. As we were leaving he went on the intercom and spoke into his microphone "Please ignore the homosexuals leaving the store."
