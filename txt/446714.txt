<inertia> i was looking up russian shirts on ebay
<inertia> my lithuanian friend has gotten lots of marxist/socialist stuff off of there
<inertia> they sell red beach towels with a yellow insignia of the sickle and hammer for like 20 bucks
<inertia> i might buy one
<Bl1tz> lol
<Bl1tz> that is sweet
<Bl1tz> although painfully ironic
<inertia> how??
<Bl1tz> paying 20$ for a towel that has a symbol of everything that was wrong with paying 20$ for a towel
