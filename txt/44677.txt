<Killrbyte> In Oregon, they give food stamps on a debit-type card, called the Oregen Trail card.  But they're given in two ways: Either Cash or Food.  If its Food, then they can only buy Food with it, if its Cash (Which is rare), then they can anything, or even just cash out the card when it gets recharged
automatically.  I'm not sure who gets which, but I know my tax money goes to it.
<Prozzy> The Oregeon Trail Card, do you have to shoot buffalo also if you have the card? What about your family, if they're starving or dying, can you just take them out back and shoot them?
<qrg> whev youve nearly run out of credit on your oregon trail card do you get to take a raft ride
<arse-poet> i love the really old school oregon trail game, where you go hunting and you like shoot a pixel at a blob of pixels representing a buffalo
<Prozzy> I know when I carry around my Orgeon Trail Card, Indians come out of nowhere and shoot arrows at my car
