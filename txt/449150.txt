[remROM] hmmmm, a pretty girl once sat next to me in the computer room then sneezed.
[remROM] I said "gbless you" and she said "thanks". Then she sneezed again and I blessed her. THen she blew her nose. Then sneezed again. Then a guy came by and she left with him. Then 2 days later i had the flu.
[remROM] I guess i could brag that she gave me a disease.
[remROM] and oraly transmitted disease at that.
