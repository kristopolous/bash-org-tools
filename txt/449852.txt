<weht> hahaha this morning i was listening to the radio on the bus, and they were like 'its time for the not-so-impossible question. what do the first 7 gifts in the 12 days of christmas have in common?'
<weht> and this dude calls in and is like 'they are all birds' and they say 'yay you win you get this gay prize'
<weht> and i called in and said 'um, how long have 5 golden rings been birds?' and they said 'oh shit, we screwed that up'
