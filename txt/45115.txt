<Rhyos> Anyone wanna hear a bad geology joke?
<Midknight> go on, humor us
<Rhyos> Ok. A bit of background.
<Rhyos> Everyone know what halite is?
<Midknight> if it fails then you will have to be killed a most imaginative and horrible way :)
<Rhyos> It's just a big block of salt.
<Rhyos> *not the joke*
<Rhyos> Anyways, basalt is the stuff that's on the ocean floor.
<Rhyos> So... what do geologists call the stuff on the ocean floor?
<LordJD> fish shit
<Rhyos> Sheep halite. *it was on a test* Fish shit is probably even funnier.
