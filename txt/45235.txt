<Rune> my car blew up when half a dozen of diaz's friggin cronies rammed their cars into mine
<+Shadow> lol
<+Shadow> heh I hate it when someone cuts you off in a motorcycle and bumps you into a cop
<+Shadow> and then you try to run away but you can't get on the bike with the cop near
<+Shadow> so you have to kill the cop
<+Shadow> then you have two stars for no real reason
<Rune> I hate it when taxis make sharp turns when you're going high speed on a motorcycle
<Jamie_M> for a second there
<Jamie_M> i thought "wait shadow owns a motorcycle"
<Jamie_M> but then i realized nobody in here EVER talks about real life.
