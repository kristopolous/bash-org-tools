<Silent69> Hey did you take the $5 dollars that was sitting on my desk the last time you were here
<Cactus> Ya, the movie we rented wasnt rewound and they called me up saying I had to pay a stupid fee for not rewinding the damn thing. And I was on my way back to the video store so I might as well had paid it off.
<Silent69> Oh ok. Just wondering where it went.
<Cactus> no prob man, gtg, peace.
***Cactus has left the conversation***
