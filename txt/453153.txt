<dmsndlr> You know, it was kinda hard being the only jewish kid in a small town..
<dmsndlr> I'm tall, so I used to play in the church's basketball team and everytime I stepped on court the ref went "FOUL!"
<dmsndlr> And I was like "What, I didn't even do anything!"
<dmsndlr> "Well you did kill Jesus."
