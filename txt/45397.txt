<qrg> how do they deal with dice rolling
<cmplx> you need vr dice. they're usb.
<cmplx> then you put on these special glvoes
<cmplx> and roll them acrtoss a vr desk.
<cmplx> no, ass, you click a button and the dice are rolled for you
<qrg> i meant the randomization
<qrg> of the dice being rolled
<orion> i've never heard of a computer spitting out a random number
<orion> or a random quote
<orion> never.
<nyisles> qrg: cat /dev/urandom
<orion> thus, random numbers from dice == impossible
<orion> it's not like computers generate photorealistic motion pictures
<orion> or perform millions and billions and trillions of intense calculations per second
<orion> i seriously doubt they could simulate die being rolled
<orion> i mean jesus, they control the stockmarket and most modern finance, big business, corporations
<orion> but as far as picking two random numbers from 1 to 6
<orion> it's fucking unfathomable.
<cmplx> until computers can acccurately model the behavior of a giant glob of cum entering the earth's atmosphere, computer science has failed.
