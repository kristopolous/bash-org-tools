<evilada> is it right to cheat on a paper for ethics class?
<evilada> i mean im just saying
<evilada> things would get done a whole lot quicker
<evilada> and it would be a wonderful practice in irony
<mike310> what if you get caught?
<evilada> just say it was some ass backwards experiment about ethics and shit. You'll probably get an A.
