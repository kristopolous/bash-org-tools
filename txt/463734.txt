(@Blaxthos) CANTON, Georgia (AP) -- Christmas is still going strong for 14-year-old Nick Waters.
(@Blaxthos) When the boy's church asked what he wanted for Christmas, Nick, who cannot talk and was born with no arms, slowly typed his reply with his feet: Lots of Christmas cards. Ten thousand of them.
