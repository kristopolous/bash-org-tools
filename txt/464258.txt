<vapoR> lately my mother has been complaining about how much time the dad has been spending in the computer room..
<vapoR> she comes up to me and goes "For christmas, I want you to get your father a gift that will get him out of that stupid computer room!"
<vapoR> so i went out and purchased him a wireless router :p
