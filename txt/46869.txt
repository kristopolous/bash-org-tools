<+DrDiamond> I had a hot dog in Steamboat Springs Colorado at the Kum n' Go market
<+DrDiamond> no joke
<+DrDiamond> terrible name
<@kelea> least it wasn't in Climax, Colorado.
<+DrDiamond> I'll bet Climax has one
<+DrDiamond> it's a chain
<@kelea> lordy.  A chain of Kum 'n Go sounds like my date life.
