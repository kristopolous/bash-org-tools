<BloodFromStone> XP probably has a button that summons local monkeys to brutalize my isp.
<[Sl]Ashy> no, bfs
<[Sl]Ashy> I'm afraid that first the monkeys duct tape you to a chair and taunt you, then proceed to take off your clothing, take pictures for later blackmail, and -then- rip your ISP's server to shreds.
<BloodFromStone> o_o
<BloodFromStone> XP is dangerous.
<[Sl]Ashy> Yes.
<Iepetus> yeah
<[Sl]Ashy> Handle with care.
<Iepetus> monkeys seem cute and all

<Iepetus> or so I hear
