<TDS> THAT MAKE NO SENSE ANYWAY. IF 50 % OF AMERICANS ARE BELOW AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE, HOW CAN IT BE AVERAGE?
<SneakAtack> TDS is an idiot. half the people are below the average and half the people are above the average. that's why it's an average.
<Moik> >_< TDS makes the upper half possible.
<Bob_Dole> ROFL @ Moik
<SneakAtack> hehee
<SneakAtack> I feel almost bad. I should have waited for more people to reply and then agreed with TDS.
<TDS> that was a momentary lapse. my iq has been found to be 163.
<FFVI> You forgot a decmial point, TDS
<SneakAtack> TDS: 163 with a mean of 500?
