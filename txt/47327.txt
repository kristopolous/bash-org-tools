<Killrbyte> HAHAHA.  My Dad just told me that once when he was in school he took a blank tape, recorded someone screaming about 30 minutes into it, and put it in a tape player and pressed Play right before the end of class.  Then he left it there so during the next class, they suddenly hear a loud scream in the middle
of class from this damn tape player.
