<Ashpool> I have offically reached full bachelorhood.  Use a plate...then chuck it out.
<SirPNut> sif need plate.. eat it straight from the frypan
<@Agg> plate?  pfft, amateur.  when you eat directly off the table, magazines, chairs, etc..
<SirPNut> then throw the frypan out
<@aftahours> cook everything in the one pot, drain the pot then eat outta the pot :) tastes better that way
<@Agg> or with my cooking, pour the food out of the pot and eat the pot, it's more tasty
