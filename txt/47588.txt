Ibekev: yeah that does, I guess you never really know until you meet someone and I'm not trying to put any assumptions into any of this other than I am willing to meet new people and learn more about myself and them at the same time, I don't think you can go out there looking for you soul mate or whatever, it just
happens but it won't happen if you're just sitting on your couch

Ibekev: So I guess the rule of thumb is to see this as a way to meet new friends and just see
