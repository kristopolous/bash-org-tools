<JaG> whos taking me out to dinner tonight?
<FairWtns> We could do a group thing.
<FairWtns> <ahem> A group dinner thing.
<FairWtns> <ahem> A group dinner meaning food thing.
<FairWtns> Or we could just say fuck it and see if we could do the group thing.
<JaG> being the only chic in here, im vehemently opposed to the group thing, i dont have that many orifices
<FairWtns> Oh, I don't know, you have enough, I would say.
<JaG> 4 guys, 1 girl
<JaG> NOT enough orifices
<FairWtns> Well, how are we defining 'orifice'
<JaG> its gotta feel good to me too sweetums
<FairWtns> Yeah yeah, "what's in it for me"
<FairWtns> Typical female philosophy.
<JaG> Better than whats in me for it?
