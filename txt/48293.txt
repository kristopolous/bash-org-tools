<[smurf]> MelowRage: you are a sick, sick, sick child
<MelowRage> I know
<[smurf]> even the name MelowRage pisses me off
<[smurf]> it tears me
<MelowRage> SCORE
<[smurf]> I am seared
<MelowRage> I was hoping it would piss someone off
<[smurf]> SEARING RAGE OF MELLOWNESS
<MelowRage> what with the blatant misspelling and such
<MelowRage> It was either "MelowRage" or "MellowRag"
<[smurf]> it makes me want to flip out and listen to Jazz at the same time
<MelowRage> I chose the former
<MelowRage> hehehe
<MelowRage> VIOLENT JAZZ MUSIC!!!
<[smurf]> STOP IT
<[smurf]> HAVE YOU EVER FLIPPED OUT TO JAZZ CORPERAL?!
<[smurf]> IT'S NOT SOMETHING A GROWN MAN SHOULD DO!
<MelowRage> like a music video of some black dude going nuts and shoving his saxophone into a guy's eyeball
<[smurf]> ..nah
<[smurf]> that's rage
<[smurf]>mellow rage would be the Micheal Jackson video where they get all ready to knife fight and then they just dance with their hands together
