<Rufus>  Damn, a job at blizzard would certainly be cool
<Shinji>  nah
<Shinji>  you'd get your paycheck 7 months after you are supposed to
<Rufus>  So true
<Rufus>  And it would be "patched" and "downgraded" by that time
<Rufus>  Your net result would be a check for 5 bucks with "gogogogogogoggogogo" written all over it
<Shinji>  But don't forget
<Shinji>  There'd be a dupe bug, so you could get double your pay as much as you want
<Rufus>  You'd have to throw the check on the ground, then pick it up and your pocketbook at the same time
<Shinji>  ... but then you'd lag trying to cross the street to get to the bank, get hit by a bicyclist repeatedly, and die :)
