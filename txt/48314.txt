<Somebob> Apparently, I said something about some filesharing program in the topic once.
<Staberinde> Except when it comes in contact with you fucking idiots who use spyware infected cockshit
<Staberinde> It added a reg key which just added an annoying "CANNOT LOAD XXX.DLL" message on start to my startup
<Staberinde> Since I had neutered it
<Staberinde> Then I removed it from my registry since that CANNOT LOAD annoyed me.
<Somebob> I never recommended kazaa goddamnit
<Staberinde> I neuter everything I come in contact with just to make sure it doesn't fuck me.
<Staberinde> OVER.
<Staberinde> shit
