<+SLing> I think I have just won the award for computer stupidity
<Gau> How's that?
<+SLing> ok
<+SLing> I just installed this disk cleanup software that I had ran before with no problems
<+SLing> and I cleaned up a bunch of files
<+SLing> then I restarted because my internet connection was going strange
<+SLing> my computer begins to boot and I see this "NLTDR is mising" error
<+SLing> I had no idea what the fuck I had done so I popped in my windows 2000 CD and ran a repair install
<+SLing> the repair went fine but when I restarted again I had that error
<+SLing> so I'm like "Oh shit, I fucked up my computer"
<+SLing> I start freaking out
<+SLing> and then I realize
<+SLing> THERES A FUCKING UNFORMATTED FLOPPY DISK IN MY DISK DRIVE
<+SLing> -_-;;;;;;;;;;;;
