<Nazgul> my grandma got some pictures developed, and she was showing them to me, and said that they must have accidently one of someone else's pictures in with hers
<Nazgul> because there was a pic of a woman and man standing beside each other with their dog
<Nazgul> and I was looking at it, and thinking weird..then looked in the upper right hand corner and saw a flying saucer in the sky
<Nazgul> and was like "SHIT!"
<BloodFromStone> o_o
<BloodFromStone> Don't send them back.
<Nazgul> then flipped it over and it was a promotional advertisement thing for "Taken" on the scifi channel
* Nazgul chuckles.
