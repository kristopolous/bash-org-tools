<Marticus> i'm still looking for an intelligent non-headcase female
<UgLyPuNk> they don't exist
<UgLyPuNk> all women are head cases
<toe-wk> its true
<toe-wk> heres how i break it down in geek talk for you nerds to understand
<toe-wk> males = intel pentium 4's. Cool, reliable, stable, tough
<toe-wk> females = AMD athlons, sure their sexy, and their hot...but as soon as they start thinking i wouldnt rely on one :D
<Marticus> and uh, calculators are little girls, and mainframes are bbw
<Annon201> what bout graphic calculators??
<Marticus> thats when they get some grass on the pitch
