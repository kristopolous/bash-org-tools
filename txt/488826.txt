<Devilbunny>  I just got back from a team-building meeting at work.  There was pizza and the managers did karaoke, and we played games.
<Devilbunny>  We played Cranium, basically a team based trivial pursit, with cards like "draw a picture and have your team guess what it is," or "hum this song and have your team guess."
<Devilbunny>  The last card was charades, for the word "hormone"

<Devilbunny>  So, next week's meeting will be sensitivity training.
