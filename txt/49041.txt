<waffle> for the good of mankind
<Ed> He doesn't have to promise!
<Phyresis> I don't plan on reproducing
<Phyresis> but I'm going to mold humanity to the way I see fit
<Phyresis> I'm sick of ignorant fuckers running amok
<Phyresis> we will have enlightenment or extinction
<Phyresis> take your pick
<Ed> So are you like, Asian Jesus or someshit?
