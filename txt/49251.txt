<DiskSpeed> my friend and I were talking and we thought it would be cool if instead of using transistors, processor manufacturers just shrank little sweatshop workers and made them hold hands and the electric shock would go through them
<DiskSpeed> and they would be in a maze and change whos hand they were holding for different things
<DiskSpeed> and the cache with the processor is really meth that is constantly fed to these miniature workers to keep them quick
