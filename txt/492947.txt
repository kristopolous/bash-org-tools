<baconbits> Hey, have any of you seen that AOL commercial where the guys are getting food?
<baconbits> And the AOL guy is dumping chili and jello and crap on the guy's sandwich saying that it's "Spam and viruses"
<baconbits> And then he's like "Which would you rather have, Regular highspeed with viruses and spam, or highspeed internet with AOL?
<baconbits> I got the best parody for that.
<baconbits> The guys are standing in line
<baconbits> Getting food.
<baconbits> And the Regular highspeed guy takes a crap on the sandwich
<baconbits> And says "Which would you rather have, my regular highspeed, or highspeed with AOL on it?
