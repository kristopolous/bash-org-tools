Dan: we went to "the store" in our lunch break today
Dan: there was this shop with the sign "coffee corn" above it
Dan: it was meant to be 2 different signs but it looked like one
Dan: and this girl that was with us asked "WTF is coffee corn"
Dan: then later we walked around the other side and the other part of the sign said "nuts juice"
