<frenzaldude> I can't believe that around 60% dont want an XBox!
<frenzaldude> I couldn't wait to get mine. XBox is the best gaming console of all time, even look at the stats: http://www.xbox365.com/xp_consoles.shtml
<Flashman> To quote www.maddox.xmission.com, "Saying the Xbox is a good system because it's powerful is like saying you made a great painting because you used the best set of paints."
<frenzaldude> not really, coz u might be a crap painter
<frenzaldude> anyway xbox has the best graphics and stuf, and u can put it onto the internet!!! thats my fav feature
