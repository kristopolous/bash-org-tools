#50057 +(31)- [X]
<prebullem> can I use F'(x)=[(f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)]/g(x)^2 to integrate (4-x*sqrt(x))/(2x^2) and call it F'(x) then find F(x)?

<emul8or> prebullem HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW TO DO THE PROBLEM?
<emul8or> not to mention that i already told you that your goddamn crackpot idea doesn't work
<Meta> looking at the denominator, g(x) would be sqrt(2x), g(x) and f'(x) have to be constants
<Meta> so no, and just use the fact that (a+b)/c = a/c + b/c and the power rule
<emul8or> exactly
<emul8or> as i've already told him twice
<Meta> heh
<prebullem> well
<prebullem> I don't understand why it doesn't work
<emul8or> because you pulled the idea straight out of you know where
