<@Ixnorp> LEGOS!!!
<@Ixnorp> you better not even be THINKING talking trash about legos =P
<@Ixnorp> Kj mentioned Duplos which are like Legos for retarded children
<HermyCZ> nope. Legos are cool- you screaming out 'Legos' in ecstasy caught me off guard.  ;P
<@Ixnorp> ohhh~~~  legos~~  oh oh OOOOH LEGOS!!!!! *spurt*
<Kjorteo> Hmm.  If you think about it, you could make an interesting sex toy out of legos.  You'd need to do something about the sharp jagged corners of the rectangular design, of course, but if you can take care of that, the bump things they have on the surface to put more legos on...hee, yeah.  It's like the next
step up from being ribbed. :-b
<@Ixnorp> Kj: but "dotted for her pleasure" doesnt exactly have the same ring
<Kjorteo> WHat's more important, the jingle or how the thing feels when it's stuffed inside you? ;b
