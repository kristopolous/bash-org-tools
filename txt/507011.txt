<Ashryd> Prepare for the new revolution in freeing space on your hard drive, waste no more
time on searching through old files to delete, simply leave it up to DaveBot!
<Methuen> New program aye?
<Ashryd> Doesn't work quite right yet though...
<Ashryd> Does something a little more interesting at the moment...
<Methuen> Oh?
<Ashryd> It spends 12 hours searching through your folders and files finding and sorting
them into things that must be deleted, could be deleted and mustn't be deleted, compiles the
information into a database, deems the database an item that must be deleted then erases
your whole hard drive.
<Methuen> o.O
