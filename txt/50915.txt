<CitizenErazed> I dunno, there are other, better things to do while you're in bed
<tomjone5> like play chess. always does it for me, anyway
<CitizenErazed> so THAT'S what you and Jen spend all your time doing, matt?
<tomjone5> yup, I can keep going for hours at a time
<tomjone5> but have you even thought of the positions you can play in? gets me all tingly just thinking about it
<CitizenErazed> tantric chess books, then?
<tomjone5> I'm still writing the kama chess, expect to see it in 'special' bookshops next month
