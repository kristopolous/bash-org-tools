[ @Hammer ] Okay, I was going to have some Count Chocula, so I started pouring a bowl. But then I ran out before I filled the bowl, so I just filled the rest with Cocoa Pebbles cause that was the only other cereal we had. So I open the fridge, and we have no milk, only chocolate milk. So yeah, I consumed about 5 years
worth of chocolate intake in that one meal.
