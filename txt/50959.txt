<bCc> Here are my Desperate Attempts To Get Rid Of AOL
<bCc> 1) I hired and exorcist to get rid of AOL on my computer. It failed to work.
<bCc> 2) I also buried CD's In holy water, the holy water evaporated but the CDs survived and now glow red...
<bCc> 3) I pissed on my AOL CD's and returned them to AOL...They sent me a thank you note for the cologne
<toc-> haha
