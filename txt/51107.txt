<EvilJoven> JESUS`Son: like you have said before, you cannot prove it, its a matter of faith
<EvilJoven> nothing you do can prove to us that the words you speak are not lies passed down from your fathers
<EvilJoven> the only thing which identifies the words in that book of yours as truth is that book, by that logic anything written is truth

<EvilJoven> ok, who packeted the lamer?
<EvilJoven> christ, I bet it was you Anjin
