<+[SFX]Newbie0> I had a dog once
<+[SFX]Newbie0> my mom always told me when I got a boo-boo, to let the dog lick it
<+[SFX]Newbie0> said it was antiseptic
<+[SFX]Newbie0> One time, I had a sore throat
<@[EoK]cheaptrick> I can see where this is going..
<+[SFX]Newbie0> God I miss that dog
<@[EoK]cheaptrick> ew..
<+|WM|ePi> haha
