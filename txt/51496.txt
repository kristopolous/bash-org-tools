<webby_g[work]> some guy just forgot his login and NEEDED to print out some work, so I let him login into my account and print it off, aren't I NICE?
<Zarei> no now all your bases will belong to him
<webby_g[work]> he was supervised, so if he did try to me up me the bomb, he would have had no chance to survive make his time.
