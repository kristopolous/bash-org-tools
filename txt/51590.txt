<DA_BUTCHER> Annie will you marry me?
<DA_BUTCHER> I don't care what gender you are!
<|Annie|> shizz
<DA_BUTCHER> I'm Greek
<|Annie|> that's like the 6th time someone's asked me that in here
<|Annie|> I'll get back to you k ._.
<Scotch> It's your own fault for making your gender so obvious in your nick
<DA_BUTCHER> yes but the others would freak out if you turned out to be a 30 year old wrestler named Bernard
