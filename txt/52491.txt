<Boogieman> possibly the wierdest thing ever just happend.
<Boogieman> I really had to take a piss so I ran to the bathroom.
<Boogieman> and I ran into the room, but I didn't know that my dad put a new mat in there.
<Boogieman> Ususally bathroom mats have those anti slip things on the bottom, but this one didn't
<Boogieman> and I sliped, smashed my shoulder on the toiled, pissed myself, and cried out in pain
<Boogieman> my dad comes down and is like "what happened!?... wait, you know what, I don't want to know" and then goes upstairs
