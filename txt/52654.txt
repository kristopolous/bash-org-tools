<_wookie_> hehe Eli was just telling me a funny story, she was helping someone in the building here who couldn't open a jpg in Photoshop, everytime she clicked it would open the image in IE,  when she showed her how she wanted to know how to remove the border from the image, eli had to explain that the image had no
border, that was the photoshop application surrounding the picture.
<elo> thats advanced n00bism ;-)
