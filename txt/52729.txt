<NuttO> "Spammers are those morally challenged induhviduals and organisations that steal resources, hijack mailservers and trample over every Term of Service and Acceptable Use Policy that stands in their way in their quest to dump unsollicitated mail into your mailbox." http://216.127.43.94/angel/img/dp/dp0001.jpg
<NuttO> I like how somebody who draws angels fucking each other is morally outraged by spammers.
