<Crack[H]eaD> That brings up an interesting point.... According to the license agreement of some software you dont own it... you are merely renting it
<Crack[H]eaD> so by downloading the software am I borrowing it?
<Lasuuco> yeah crack
<Lasuuco> hence the term
<Lasuuco> "licensed"
<Crack[H]eaD> I should make a bunch of bumper stickers that say "Borrowing is not a crime" ;)
<bigfoot> could i borrow one?
<Crack[H]eaD> Fuck yeah
