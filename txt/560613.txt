<Black_Kniggit> That's nothing compared to back when I played Fallout 2
<Black_Kniggit> I stole the coins from every NPC in the entire game!
<Black_Kniggit> and I didn't just steal it as such, I stole it one coin at a time until I had five coins (unless if I failed in which case I would load my game and try again) then I got 150 exp and saved my game. Then I did it again. This gave me A LOT of exp points.
<Medmera> WTF?
<Black_Kniggit> Sometimes I used the steal skill to give them back money, so I could steal some more
<Medmera> you will lose your virginity in your next life.
