<drlion> what size t-shirt fits me?
<drlion> i'm a thin, normal-height 17 year old guy
<drlion> medium? large?
<moira> consult a pre-existing tshirt in the wooden object located in your current domicile, also known as a "chest of drawers"
<drlion> damn it
<drlion> i would never have thought of that
<drlion> thanks
