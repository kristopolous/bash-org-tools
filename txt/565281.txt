<cjr> My dad was in Edinburgh on holiday, and he was walking around a street with lots of expensive restaurants
<cjr> And there was a homeless guy selling magazines at the corner
<cjr> So he bought one, and had a chat
<cjr> Then he asked "Do you know any good restaurants around here?"
<cjr> The homeless guy just stares at him for about ten seconds and says "Yeah, I don't really eat out very often... but I'd imagine they are all pretty good"
<cjr> I think my dad ran away after that
