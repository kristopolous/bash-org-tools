<blitzoid> My ma got me a copy of PC Gamer'
<blitzoid> I was like "Did you save the receipt?"
<Jarky> haha why?
<ChaosMage> Parents think gamers like those gay gaming mags
<ChaosMage> Makes you wonder who the hell reads 'em
<d0gZpAw> i used to like PC Gamer.. when i was on dialup.. because it was a pain in the ass downloading demos to see whether a full release is worth 2 days of leech
<blitzoid> "HOW TO MANIPULATE THE CAMERA TO LOOK AT LARA'S ASS! PLUS: OTHER DIGITAL BOOBS." - Sample from PC Gamer
