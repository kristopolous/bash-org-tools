<Daidoji> speaking of old nes games, I recall carrying out clandestine operations in terms of game rentals
<Daidoji> for example, renting a copy of dragon warrior 4, and swapping the chip with urban champion.
<Daidoji> I bet there are 5 or 6 kids who think dragon warrior 4 is the worst vs fighting game ever made
