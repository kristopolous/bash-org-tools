DasKrav: We were playing a review game in history class, on the topic of the roman empire
DasKrav: The game was like this: The class divides into 8 groups, and one person rotates with the rest of the group in jeapordy-style questions,
DasKrav: and the question was "What was the name of the emperor who built a wall in britain?"
DasKrav: and nobody knew it, so he said "Here's a hint: Its named after him."
DasKrav: and so this one jock guy in my class goes,
DasKrav: "Berlin?"
