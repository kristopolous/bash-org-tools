<jayscrib> I'm hosting a few websites, how can I enable people to connect and edit their sites? FTP is a no-go, and telnet wont work will it? The server is a win98 box (and a lil note: I have a router to go through)
<LilWashu> youre hosting websites for people on a win98 machine?
<LilWashu> good luck
