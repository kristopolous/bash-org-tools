[ Tom^ ] i remember my mate had a 33k modem, and we were like you should upgrade to 56k, then his dad was like, there is no point cus most webpages wont load any faster than around 33k anyway
[ Tom^ ] that was when i thought the internet was some guy sitting in a room and when you type in a web page he got that then sent the page to ur pc
[ Tom^ ] replace man with server and i had the idea :P
[ L-uNiT ] that's an awesome system tom
[ L-uNiT ] if he doesn't feel well then he'll just go away
[ L-uNiT ] and toilet brakes mean that we'll all get 404's
[ L-uNiT ] it'd be more effecient than microsoft servers
