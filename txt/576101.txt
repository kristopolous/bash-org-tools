<Danny> Last night I was at my school at like 10pm
<Danny> waiting for my mom to pick me up
<Danny> and this minivan comes in the parking lot
<Danny> and starts doing burnouts and 180's
<Danny> it was the most pathetic thing
<Brad> heh I bet you'd say the same thing about me in my Marquis
<Danny> No, I don't think so.
<Danny> This Minivan had a "Be careful, Honor student on board." bumper sticker on it...
