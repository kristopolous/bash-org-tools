<+mirkin> does anybody know if it is possible using ms access to create a report which shows the records of a table
<+mirkin> but shows 3 columns across the page
<+mirkin> i.e
<+mirkin> record 1        record 2        record 3
<+mirkin> record 4        record 5        record 6
<+GoodScrat> That is impossible
<+GoodScrat> Computers are not that far advanced yet
