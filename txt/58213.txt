<ian_> Speaking of shaving, I was experementing with my beard trimmer's hair length settings so I decided to test it on my chest hair.  Now I have a trail of missing hair going from my crotch to my neck.  It's like you're looking from overhead at a foreset with a trail of trees cut down.
<kierabee> your chest hair is on your crotch?
<ian_> There's no clear line of where one stops and one begins.
<kierabee> that's a savory image
<ian_> kierabee, I can shave my ass hair and make a toupe.
<kierabee> why don't you just braid it and leave it in place?
<ian_> Can you  braid it for me?
