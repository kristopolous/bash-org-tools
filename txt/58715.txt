<gatewatcher> heh, last year, when my parrents made me goto ccd, i had to sit through a pro-life presentation. after, the guy asked my friend if he was pro-life. my friend goes yes, of course i am, i'm catholic. the guy goes, that's good. then my friend goes, yeah, i mean you can't eat babies unless they're born...
the guy was clearly horrified.
