<Thuryn> a standard laptop battery would also be a great idea
<Thuryn> cell phones.... *maybe*.  the phones themselves are still changing too much
<Thuryn> pretty soon, the damn phones will be so small that the air movement from your speech will also power the phone
<Thuryn> but then you couldn't talk to your g/f, because *you'd* never talk, so your phone would die
