#59595 +(297)- [X]
<chris> i have one guy arguing that init.d scripts need to support mixed-case arguments
<chris> "My first suggestion is to modify the way you match 'start' and 'stop' in
<chris> your case statement.  While technically, there is nothing wrong with the
<chris> way you match it, I prefer [Ss][Tt][Aa][Rr][Tt] and [Ss][Tt][Oo][Pp].  Using
<chris> this method, the matching is now case insensitive."
<reflector> I'd email him back: "[sS][hH][uU][tT] [tT][hH][eE] [fF][uU][cC][kK] [uU][Pp]"
<reflector> match that, asshole.
