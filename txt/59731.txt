<Anatole> That bot was from Russia.
<Anatole> And there's a e-mail address, as well!
<Rev> Russian...so it begins...
<Anatole> And a name.
<Anatole> Eeeeeeenteresting.
<DeadSnake> so, it seems we are having a new cold war now
<RAPEAPE> yeah
<DeadSnake> but it will not be fought on our lands, or our seas, or in the air, but in our homes, on IRC
<RAPEAPE> SAQ vs SOVIETS
<Rev> They struck first, with porn-bots.  But will the americans retaliate?
<DeadSnake> WE SHALL RETALIATE
<DeadSnake> but porn-bots we won't send, but email viruses!
<Rev> Mmm macros and attachments most vile.
<DeadSnake> we will contract the best hackers that china has to offer, then we do a preemptive strike on russia with a low level version of klez
<DeadSnake> then, when their defenses are down, we do a full on retaliatory strike with a modified version of the "Love Bug" virus
<Rev> Contact CNN, they'll have to get to work on their theme music.
