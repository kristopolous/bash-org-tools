<fetman> when I read the quotes on bash.org I feel that I too wan't to be as stupid as they are and make such stupid comments and make everyone laugh
<fetman> How do I become as stupid as they are?
<tfg> There are two steps, as follows:
<tfg> 1) Bang your head repeatedly on the wall until you pass out
<tfg> 2) Repeat step 1 until you get that stupid idea that you can actually be funny out of your head
