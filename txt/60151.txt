<DooD> why is it that it's always the biggest, ugliest, burliest men that get gender reassignment surgery?
<DooD> i could see getting surgery if you're like, 5 foot 3 and look kinda like a girl...
<DooD> but all these 6'4" 250 pound men with stubble and a voice deeper than james earl jones going "i feel like a woman trapped in a man's body" ...
<suzu> if you're already feminine cute looking
<suzu> you wouldn't need the surgery
<DooD> suzu: sure you would
<DooD> get rid of the optional material
<suzu> no way
<suzu> cuz the pretty feminine ones
<suzu> would think "i'm so fucking sexy"
<DooD> would think "im so fucking sexy it's ok to have a penis" ?
