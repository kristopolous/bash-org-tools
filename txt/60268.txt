<CactusJac> STEVEL = WELL I FORGOT WHAT HAPPENED BUT I KNOW IT FUCKING PISSED ME OFF AND THERE WAS SOME GREASEBALL IN THE BACK ROOM WHO LOOKED LIKE THIS JOKER, SO I GUESS MY ADVICE IS TO WATCH YOUR STEP IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU, BECAUSE ALL BETS ARE OFF WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR GODDAMN HOUSE IN THE MORNING, AND YOU
FORGET TO BRING YOUR WALLET OR WEAR PANTS, AND THE FUCKING COPS PULL YOU OVER BECAUSE YOUR EYES AREN'T SO GREAT ANYMORE
