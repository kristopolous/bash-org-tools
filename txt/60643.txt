<Sarin_Died> I forgot to turn off the alarm on my alarm clock last night, so the radio turned on at 10:30am thismorning
<Sarin_Died> and I hear a car commercial saying "Attention, would the person with the late 1980's station wagon with fake wood panels please move your car, you are blocking 7 parking places" and I got up thinking DAMNIT I have to move my car
