<Sarah> lol, i was at a speech and debate tournament in 9th grade at a public high school in albuquerque.  the counselor's office was right next to the culinary arts office.  on the counselor's office window, there was a poster that said "Suicide: A permanent solution to a temporary problem" and on the culinary arts
window there was a poster that read: "Use the right knife"
