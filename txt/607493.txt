<Azn> This guy came to our school, and talked to us about how drinking and driving is bad...
<Azn> And he mentioned that if you are convicted, you will have a breathalizer installed in your car, so you have to breathe into a tube to start your car...
<Azn> And some guy shouted "What if you fart in it?"
<Azn> Everyone laughed, and the speaker looked pissed and said "Well, gas expelled from the anus contains methane, not alcohol.  It would be difficult for an intoxicated person to perform such an action with their distorted hand-eye cordination"
