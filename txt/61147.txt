<Dark_Ayanami> Popups have been around since the dawn of porn. Prehistoric, pornographic cave paintings would interrupt primitive man's masturbation with other paintings popping up hawking larger genitalia/clubs/wheels/fires.
<Dark_Ayanami> Then the first man would bash the new painter with his club (a primitive version of a mouse) and get back to "work".
<Dark_Ayanami> This is the first demonstrated case of "popup rage".
