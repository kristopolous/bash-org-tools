#61513 +(1247)- [X]
<Scibert> Three @s for the IRCops under the sky
<Scibert> Seven for the Op Lords in their channels of stone
<Scibert> Nine for Mortal Chatters doomed to die
<Scibert> One for the Dark Peer on his Dark Throne
<Scibert> In the land of Ping where the Netsplits lie.
<Scibert> One @ to rule them all
<Scibert> One @ to find them
<Scibert> One @ to bring them all
<Scibert> And in the darkness, bind them
<Scibert> In the Land of Ping, where the Netsplits lie.
