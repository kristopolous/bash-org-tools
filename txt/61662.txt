<b1u3> when i was in like 5th grade, a DARE cop came to visit our class
<b1u3> he was going through his whole deal like 'yes im a real police officer, and this is a real gun on my belt, and if you try to grab it im trained to break your arm upon reflex' and of course we had a doped up kid with ADD in our class who only heard 'this is a real gun, try to grab it'
