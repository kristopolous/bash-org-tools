<Fong Pei> So... today in class, we were playing with voice recognition on a power book.
<Fong Pei> Someone told it "Computer, destroy the world as we know it"
<Fong Pei> Right after that was said... someone else's laptop finishes booting up and plays the windows sound...
<Fong Pei> whole class bursted out laughing
