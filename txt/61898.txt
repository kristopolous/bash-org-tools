<FIFpe> Dude, can you ask Andrew to look for my wallet when he gets home
<FIFpe> Cause I need it hard
<Qinop> yeah
<Qinop> he has it hard
<FIFpe> THANK THE LORD ALMIGHTY
<FIFpe> Tell him to stick it...in his mail-box, and I"ll pick it up on the way to church
<Qinop> we don't have a box, we have a slot
<Qinop> actually it's more like a chute
<Qinop> so we will stick it in our "door"
<FIFPe> sweet
