<marcc> What kind of company includes a program called "pimp ass newsreader" with a server OS
<Ver> uhmm.. the company that makes "pimp ass newsreader"?
<Kaeto> dude... your server has to have SOME way to get warez
<marcc> But pimp ass newsreader? With a fucking OS that's supposedly made by people with jobs and stuff?
<marcc> Why not include a Bitching Media Player, or Muthafuckin' Desktop
<Dritzen> marcc:  What distro is that?
