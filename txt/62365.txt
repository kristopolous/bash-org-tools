<Rabbitoh> hehe 2 years ago I went to Fox Studios in Sydney where they held the annual 'sexpo' and there was a chick demonstrating a way in which to make a caste of ones genitals using a fast drying seaweed based liquid to the groin. she was on stage standing like a bow legged cowboy, slapping the stuff on her axe
mark beneath her skirt. mmm classy. she then said it'd be great for guys to carry the replica pussy in their pockets to play with.. yeahh.. ok lol
<punkrockgirl> you know what else is classy? using the phrase "axe mark"
