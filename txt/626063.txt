<chuck> I just got two CDs from AOL. Two CDs in one package. One is gold, for dial-up. The other is Silver, for Cable/DSL broadband. They came in a box that was half gold and half silver. The back of the box enumerates the difference between the two available plans.
<chuck> The CDs have different features listed on their labels.
<chuck> I diff'd them. They're identical.
