<FlipTopBx> damnit, last night i fell asleep with my space heater on.
<FlipTopBx> i had three boxes of Cracker Jack, each with the contents fused together into a sort of super-popcorn.
<nitrifik_> neat
<nitrifik_> eat them
<FlipTopBx> heh.  that would be the obvious thing to do.  i'm not in the process of trying to "thaw" them out.
