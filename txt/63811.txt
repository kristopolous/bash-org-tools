<etoilet> i went into the D&D store cuz they had old capcom arcade booths for sale,  and my girlfriend followed me in.  All the guys were sitting at a table playing D&D,  and this one long haired dude got up out of his seat, strode up to my gf, bowed and said "May I help you my lady?"
<crunchyfish> I don't know, man. That's pretty smooth. What was his charisma? 17? 18?
