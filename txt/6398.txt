<James> well i was walking down the street the other day
<James> not paying attention to the 40 foot beast of a dong in my pants
<James> when it slipped out and was laying across a 6 lane highway
<James> thank god it was late out
<James> i pulled it back in right as a car drove by
<garorm> thank god, the car would have been totaled
