<Javin> God I hate people.
<Javin> I'm trying to program here, and some chick walks in and starts gabbing over my shoulder about nonsense.
<Javin> So I continue to work, and just ignore her.  Apparently, she took this to mean I was "frowning."
<Javin> Her: "You know, it takes 36 muscles to frown, and only 12 to smile."
<Javin> Me: "And none at all to ignore you with utter indifference."
<Javin> Apparently that wasn't as subtle as I thought it was.  She took the hint.
