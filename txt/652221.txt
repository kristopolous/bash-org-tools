<lunchbox> so get this
<lunchbox> i delivered pizza to the Microshaft building today but I couldn't park close to the door because they have all these fancy picnic tables out back for their employees
<lunchbox> so they're standing there watching me carry all these pizzas to them and I finally get to the door and they stiff me. nothing.
<fallingdogs> are you surprised?
<lunchbox> next time they order I'm going to send them a bunch of empty boxes
<lunchbox> and write stop messages inside
<lunchbox> "0x0000000A" ...
<lunchbox> "INVALID_PROCESS_ATTACH_TIP"
