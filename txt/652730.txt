<heywood_jablomi> A lady came in today with her resume written down on notebook paper by hand and asked me if I could help her "copy and paste it onto the internet."
<my_smelly_funk> lmao
<heywood_jablomi> It was 4:30-ish and I leave at 5, so I told her to hold it up against her monitor for about 45 mins and it would copy itself onto the internet.
