<Nacho> So, you have several types of tourist: You have the "I'm on vacation, so I'm just gonna relax" types, that just wear comfy clothes.
<Nacho> You then have the "I'm in some place special, so I'm going to dress nice" types.
<Nacho> And then you have the "What happens in $location stays in $location, so I'm going to dress like an exhibitionist slut" types.  I like those... ;-)
