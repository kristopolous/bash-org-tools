<GoreJanez> I hate that captain of Enterprise from star trek
<GoreJanez> He's like an irc-newby
<GoreJanez> when he meets someone in space, he's all like: "hi, how are you, where are you from, wanna be my friend?"
<R_Nereda> #gothicmetal solar system would be his final frontier
<GoreJanez> he'd got attacked by ban-beams in no time
