<Meyow> remember back in 1996
<Meyow> when you used to think about 2000
<Meyow> and get all these space suits
<Meyow> you know why its not like that
<Meyow> I blame IRC
<Meyow> :P
<Meyow> more chatting then thinking
<Meyow> like what 80% of the world uses IRC now
<Meyow> "you have joined #sony"
<Meyow> "so what should our next product be"
<Meyow> "how about space suitS?"
<Meyow> *  idiot has been kicked by boss (your fired)
