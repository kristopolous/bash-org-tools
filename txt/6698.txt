<[enki]> I think you had that one coming, Mack.
<[enki]> Besides, I told you he'd get the wrong impression if you sent him those chocolates.
* Fiction makes moon eyes at mack
* [enki] shakes his head.
<[enki]> I knew this would happen.
* Fiction writes bad poetry about his love for mack
* [enki] preps the firehose.
* Fiction buys a harley and a tshirt that says: "if you can read this, Mack fell off" on the back
<Fiction> someday I'll buy you a cubic-zirconium ring and we can move to a trailer in Rock Springs Wyoming
