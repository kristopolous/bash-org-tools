<Eric> Horseback Archery.
<Eric> D00d, drive-by shooting. It's a sign of the times.
<Kataclysm> Yes, but  a ride-by shooting just doesn't have the same effect as a drive-by.
<Eric> Good point. ANYONE can kill a horse, but a car doesn't stagger when it's down.
<Kataclysm> That, and horses don't have tinted power windows either.
