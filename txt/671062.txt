<Phroziac> why do they make such huge suvs?
<Phroziac> i went to a car dealership today and saw one with a hood that was higher than the roof on my friend's volvo.
<Phroziac> and it's an OL, it's not like it's a small car.
<Dawson> At the rate they're going, there will be SUVs big enough to use Hummer H1s as escape pods.
