<iMP> my friend just told me a horrible story
<iMP> so, he came to a shop on his bike and left it at the entrance
<iMP> he was inside the shop only for about 5 minutes
<iMP> when he came out, the bike was still there, but obviously something was wrong
<iMP> taking a close look, he noticed the absense of pedals.
<iMP> the country where people steal things they don't need at all just out of boredom has no future :(
