* araignee doesn't care for DiCaprio.  He's not to her taste.
Rapunzel452: He used to be able to act.  Then he decided he didn't need to anymore.  I have little respect for an actor who lets himself get upstaged by a ship.
hetros: I believe his enormous head, while an religious object in New Guinea, scares some folk.
