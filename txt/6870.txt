Brucha: I've heard a Kirk/Spock/Scotty slash done similarily.  It haunts my nightmares, I don't need a wrestling equivalent added.  :)  "The Vulcan emotion is strong and powerful...I, I can't contain it all..."  "You get that thing away from him!"
Jim Smith: So, Kirk and Spock had an orgy and didn't invite Bones?  I mean, who's gonna give you more gay sex satisfaction?  A Scotsman?  Or a guy named "Bones"?
Brucha: Something like that...  Scotty stumbles upon them, tries to break it up, and then falls to the passion...
Jim Smith: He's such a slut...
TangleToy: *wipes off screen*  I swear.  Why I bother trying to drink anything while in here is beyond me.
