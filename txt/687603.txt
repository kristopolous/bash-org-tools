<ad_man> ya so me and mitch were sittin in english
<ad_man> and we always had a habit of writing dumb stuff in each other's books
<ad_man> so he writes in my book "adam is a fagget"
<ad_man> what we didn't know was that the teacher was standing behind us
<ad_man> so she says
<ad_man> "it's spelled -ot", and just walked on
