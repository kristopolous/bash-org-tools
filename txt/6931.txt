<Ibrahim> mike should work for tech support
<Ibrahim> not any company in particular, just tech support in genreal
<michael> Ibrahim, That seems like a good idea in theory. But take into account my acute lack of patience.
<Ibrahim> that's the point.
<Ibrahim> we record all calls, video tape you, and sell it as comedy things.
<michael> Mmmm...no.
<Ibrahim> you'd make plenty of money.
<michael> Mmmm...no.
<Ibrahim> Free Donuts.
<michael> Mmmm...no.
<Ibrahim> how about your choice of 20 nude women at your beck and call carrying large tropical drinks.
<Ibrahim> actually, we could make more money with said 20 women and the video.
<michael> How about we combine all of them?
<Ibrahim> a comedy about 20 nude women with donuts and large tropical drinks?
<LdySaphyre> I want the video of Ib trying to talk twenty women into being michael's nude servants.
<michael> Ibrahim, No. A comedy about 20 nude women seducing me and offering me large tropical drinks while I try to perform my duties as a tech support person :P
<Ibrahim> now THERE is a video!
