<_God> i'm gonna just send in a quote that says: Hi bash mod. what's up dude? sure must suck to read so much shit, ey? oh well, i'm gonna go. peace
<Proffa> or you could go to a public library and flood it with "WHY WONT YOU APPROVE ME"
<Proffa> like, 300 of those
<Proffa> :-)
<_God> haha
<_God> that's pointless spamming
<_God> i want to just send in a little "hello, thanks for your efforts" message
<Proffa> their efforts that always deny you?
<_God> ....good point.
<_God> Revised: Dear bash mod. Suck it.
