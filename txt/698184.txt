<Pongball> what's the most interesting thing that happened to you yesterday?
<Pongball> anyone!
<Arrow> Nothing yesterday
<The_Epitome> errrm
<Arrow> Well, I did get Sim Tower working yesterday
<The_Epitome> it rained extremely heavily
<The_Epitome> so I wore my ski jacket for the first time in months
<Arrow> As for today
<Arrow> I am 40 minutes from having all 601 aired episodes of Power Rangers.  =/
<Crablouse> any time I feel concerned about the direction my life is going
<Crablouse> I merely have to look in here
<Crablouse> and I feel better almost instantly
<Crablouse> good work everyone
