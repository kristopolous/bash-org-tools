<@DataBrokers> Wow I just some more skiers in Canada were caught up in another avalanche right near where those fellows died in one just last month.
<@DataBrokers> Those folks need to pay attention more it seems to me.
<crrj> Yes, teenagers, age 13-15 or so
<netnomad> It happened the day of the NASA barbeque.
<netnomad> They're just reporting it now, cuz the AP wire isn't as congested.
<@DataBrokers> OH, that's cold
<netnomad> No, actually it was kinda hot.
