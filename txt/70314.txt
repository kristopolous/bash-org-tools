<Mbwana> When i was 10 I was on a ferry and it was very windy out, so I decided to take an entire roll of toilet paper and see if I could let it all out into the wind and see if I could unroll the whole thing before it touched the water.
<Mbwana> It was quite amusing.
<Rialian> well? did you?
<Mbwana> Yes
<Rialian> hehehehe
<Mbwana> It looked very neat
<Qaulorn> you're easily amused too?
<Sealom> How far did it get before it hit the water?
<Mbwana> Of course I am, why do you think I'm on this channel?
<Qaulorn> how did it not tear? did you get the super absorbant quilted kind?
<Qaulorn> do you get the runs? share with us, we are here to help you
<Mbwana> Once I had the entire roll unraveled. I would estimate that it flew in the wind for about 1 1/2 minutes or so
<Qaulorn> was it patterned? or plain white?
<Mbwana> It plain
<Mbwana> Uh
<Mbwana> Minus the it
<Mbwana> People were awestruck at my amazing feat. People even videotaped it and took pictures of it.
<Sealom> I accuse you of lying.
