<Comrade> Dude, so the other day after school, this crazy evangelical lady randomly came up to me.
<Comrade> So she was tryin to get me to convert to Christianity and I just ignored her. But I only caught the last few words which were, "Jesus is in all of us!!"
<Comrade> So in an attempt to get her to go away, I said, "Lady, if Jesus was in me I would file charges for rape."
