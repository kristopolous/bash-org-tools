<dorkling> I think after four years I've finally managed to make my schools watch list
<dorkling> during the club fair today I found an empty booth and set up an 'I Hate You Club'
<dorkling> Stole some others clubs sign up sheet that was blank and someone elses diorama board and stuck some stuff about hate being theraputic
<dorkling> I actually had about 9 people signed up when a teacher came over and told me that she needed to confiscate everything I had
<dorkling> then she noticed the notes I was taking for an essay (on abortion)
<dorkling> one of them just happened to be a printed wiki article titled in bold letters 'Back alley abortions'
<dorkling> and she starts to take it from me
<sekoku> dorkling: Did you tell her that abortion was for another teacher?
<dorkling> I did when she started to take it
