<jaban> IRC channels are like houses...
<jaban> You can kick your friends out of your house for any reason you want, even if you're being stupid and unreasonable. You can even kick them out for no reason at all. It's YOUR house.
<jaban> Now imagine if 3-year-olds owned all the houses.
<jaban> That's IRC.
