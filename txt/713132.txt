Kamikazefish17:  sweet.  im at work but no one is here.  yet again
Mikelucky8:  That sucks. Also, Disney is ruining ANOTHER book that I read as a child by making it a movie.
Kamikazefish17:  which one now?
Mikelucky8:  the Bridge to Terabithia. It's supposed to be about some kids finding some secluded forest place and growing attached to it like an alternate reality, but instead Disney is skipping the symbolism and metaphor and going straight for freaking robopirates and beavers with collanders on their heads
