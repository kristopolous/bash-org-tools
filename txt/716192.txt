TaipeiSS: o.o I love the Harvard common app supplement.
TaipeiSS: they don't ask you stupid gay questions that you have to write essays to
zenith251: They don't want no Jibba Jabba.
TaipeiSS: the closest thing they ask is...
TaipeiSS: Briefly discuss one book that has strongly influenced you.
TaipeiSS: Briefly discuss.
TaipeiSS: That's like, a paragraph or two.
zenith251: But halfway through the space they provide "We said brief, damnit!"
TaipeiSS: Not "500 -750 words on a quote that means something to your life and how you exude it in every situation" like fuckin gayassed Cornell
zenith251: And if you keep going past that line, they don't read it.
TaipeiSS: and they get this big purple stamp that says GAY
TaipeiSS: and they stamp it on that part of your essay and print it and send it back to you in the mail
TaipeiSS: And they include a handwritten postit where they laugh at you and say you have no friends.
