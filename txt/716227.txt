<@Keron> no i think only catholics can confess
<@LordBrian> time to convert
<@Keron> no need to convert
<@Keron> jesus has already prepaid your visa sin card
<@Keron> he's already predied for your sins
<@Keron> it's like being preapproved to sin
<@liwei> that must have been a spectacular death
<@Keron> only if you don't accept him as your savior, then instead of breaking your knee caps like a loan shark
<@Keron> he sends you to hell
<@Keron> kind of a bum deal if you ask me.
<@LordBrian> sounds like a jew all right
