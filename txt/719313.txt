<HuhWhat> Since everyone's comign clean about bad things... back when I was 15 or 16, my friend invited me along to a family trip to Palm Springs. We were staying at some motel with cable, so I figured it'd be a good opportunity to watch some Iron Chef on the Food Network. Unfortunately, he would drag me out to the
hot springs and the pool where I, who can't swim, would usually be the butt of his little pranks. He would drag me down under into the deep end and jab his fingers into my rib to try to make me drown. Anyways, at around 9:00pm, we came back into our room to enjoy the instant noodles his parents were making. I snuck
into bathroom to take a piss and while I was doing so I noticed his little sister's bathing suit hanging over curtains of the bathtub/shower. It seemed pretty clear that she had left it there after having taken her shower. I couldn't resist and hoping nobody was outside, I pulled it down and sniffed the crotch area
where
<HuhWhat> Whoops.
<HuhWhat> Don't read that!
<HuhWhat> Fuck.
