<Miro-kun> An F-111 was flying escort with a B-52 and generally making a nuisance of himself by flying rolls around the lumbering old bomber.
<Miro-kun> The message for the B-52 crew was, "Anything you can do, I can do better."
<Miro-kun> Not to be outdone, the bomber pilot announced that he would rise to the challenge.
<Miro-kun> The B-52 continued its flight, straight and level, however.
<Miro-kun> Perplexed, the fighter pilot asked, "So? What did you do?"
<Miro-kun> "We just shut down two engines."
