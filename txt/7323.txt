<Kisa> Don&#8217;t laugh, but every once in a while I try to check if I by any chance have superpowers.  For some reason I always try telekinesis.
<Kisa> I look at something for a while, and try to move it with my mind.
<Kisa> and when I fail, I feel really stupid.
<Kisa> I was just wondering if anyone else does something like that?
<Kojedub> Yeah.
<Kojedub> I feel really stupid too.
* Kisa feels glad that he is not alone
<Kojedub> Not in relation to telekinesis.
<Kojedub> Just, you know.
<Kojedub> Stupid.
