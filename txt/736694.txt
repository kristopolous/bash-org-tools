<Naruto> It's always a haunted attic, isn't it?
<Naruto> It's never a haunted toliet that explodes with water at 3am.
<Naruto> That would be the shit.
<Naruto> literally. >)
<Naruto> If I were a ghost, that's the kind of random shit I'd do.
<Naruto> I'd open the fridge and take out all the mustard.
<Naruto> Then I'd hoard it and bring it back later and put it in the dishwasher.
<Naruto> and the people would open it up "WTF?! There's 39 jars of mustard in here!"

<Naruto> I would hoard those like nobody's business.
<Naruto> I'd be a fun ghost.
