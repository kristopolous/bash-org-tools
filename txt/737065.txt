Joe: Here's an issue I never had to worry about in CA. Does anyone know if an Hard Drive that is roughly -10C in temperature from being in the back of a UPS truck and then the porch, really dislikes being asked to spin up?

MisterX: put it in the microwave for 5 seconds
Joe: Oh, thanks!
Joe: Be right back.
Joe left the chat room.
Andy: Is he serious?
