MisterMunshun: I used to be a telemarketer, working for the Shriners. I'd call people up and try and get them to sponsor a group of needy and handicapped kids from the Shriner's hospitals to go see the circus.
MisterMunshun: One night, i'm making my calls, and i come to this name on one of my sheets
MisterMunshun: "Mrs. Pucci"
MisterMunshun: I'm making the calls before it, but i'm just going through the motions, because in my head, over and over, i'm thinking
MisterMunshun: DON'T SAY PUSSY DON'T SAY PUSSY DON'T SAY PUSSY IT'S POO-CHI POO-CHI NOT PUSSY DON'T SAY PUSSY
MisterMunshun: So, I dial her up
MisterMunshun: She answers
MisterMunshun: "Hello, Mrs. Pussy?"
MisterMunshun: everyone in the office immediately bursts into laughter, and i just fucking deflate.
MisterMunshun: I can't fucking apologize because everyone is laughing, which is making ME laugh.
MisterMunshun.: And it wouldn't have mattered anyway, she'd already fucking hung up.
Jake: and you were fired
