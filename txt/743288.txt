<Gumby-> so another guy found you sexy.  so what?
<Alchav> I guess you had to be there :/
<Gumby-> I do community theater, where 80% of the guys are gay.  One time the director came up to me, wanted to make me feel uncomfortable, and said something like "hey big guy, so....boxers or briefs?" ...
<Gumby-> so to mess with him, I look at him and say "Neither.  womens"
<Gumby-> he says "Ooh, that's getting me all excited now."   I then return with "Look, it's no secret.  I may be strong enough for a man, but I'm made for a woman".  He laughed and walked away
<Gumby-> Lesson learned: The key to getting someone to stop creeping you out, is to out-do them.  :)
