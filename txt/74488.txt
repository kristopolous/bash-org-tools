( +la_haine ) some bloke just turned up at my office saying he was here for an interview with the BBC
( mademoiselle ) wtf
( +la_haine ) that's what I said
( _seb_ ) do you work at the bbc?
( +la_haine ) well, no
( +la_haine ) hence my confusion
( mademoiselle ) it would have been even funnier if you were in taiwan
( _seb_ ) ah then i can see how you would be confused
( +seraph ) ROFL
( +la_haine ) it's like 'sorry, I think you're in the wrong city'
( mademoiselle ) hehe
( +la_haine ) 'there's no BBC here'
( +la_haine ) 'you want London - about 2 hours that way'
