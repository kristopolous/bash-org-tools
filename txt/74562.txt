<Rose_w> *** [10054] Connection reset by peer It's no Joke more
<Rose_w> I can't smile about this
<@Zardos> The server calls all clients for peers  - thus the peer the message refers to is actually your own client.
<@Zardos> What probably happens is, that your connection to the server has problems.
<@Shustrik> no, actually it's Your client who refers to the server as the peer; )
<@Zardos> either your isp or someone else on the network - perhaps the irc server itself..
<Rose_w> so you mean that i can chat without proplens
<@peer> Rose_w, you want my address?
