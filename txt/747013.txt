<pecosdave> Yeah, Snakes on a Plane not a movie you can enjoy alone.
<pecosdave> You can admit to watching the movie with a group, but watching it alone shows signs of having issues.
<jpaganel> LOL
<pecosdave> It's like Rocky Horror.  Watching it alone of the privacy of your own home makes you weird.
<pecosdave> Cross dressing and watching it with a crowd on the other hand is perfect acceptable.
