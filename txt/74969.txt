<GamInTheCity> ...why are lyrics to Komm Susser Tod in the topic?
<skyknyt> to be as depressing as possible for when Shel comes in, of course
<GamInTheCity> Oh, of course
<skyknyt> torturing people when they're down is a sign of respect and friendship
<skyknyt> much like gouging expletives on the side of another's vehicle with your key.
<GamInTheCity> You mean Friendship Marks?
