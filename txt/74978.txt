<nuhduhnewbie> socks that don't add up are obv the work of terrorists
<nuhduhnewbie> omg missing socks must be turned into turbans;o
<PuffinFreshWog> and bombs
<PuffinFreshWog> and the left over socks are broken down and then sold to a sock making factory
<PuffinFreshWog> and then all the people whos socks when missing, go and buy more
<PuffinFreshWog> and then the factory makes a lot of money
<PuffinFreshWog> and it gives a lot of it to the terrorists for making the socks go missingin the first place
<PuffinFreshWog> and that is how they get their funding
<PuffinFreshWog> its all a delicate cycle
