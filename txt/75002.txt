<TylerParker> As for the third LOTR
<TylerParker> I hope they don't leave out my favorite part of the book
<TylerParker> The part with the mushroom cloud at the end that gets frodo and jarjar binks
<Rabbitoh> dildo binks and baggar vance are the best part of LOTR
<TylerParker> And then Willy Wonka comes out and gives them two golden tickets
