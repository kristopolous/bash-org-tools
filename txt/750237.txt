<Hybridfusion> i found out last week that if you see a big black man who works for BFI (garbage truck / pickup company)
<Hybridfusion> dont ask him if BFI stands for "big fucking idiot"
<Volte> did he say "why as a matter of fact it does and id appreciate if you didnt call attention to it thanks"
<Hybridfusion> he threw a metal pipe at me and i ran like a motherfucker
