<BustaNutt> I was working in a movie theatre one time and a mother just threw her crying baby on the hard ground, i was like WTF!! the other ushers had to calm me down coz i was fuckin pissed the rest of the day
<Abstruse> Busta: I almost had to call the cops on this one woman when I was working in the bookstore because her child calmly walked up and quietly asked 'Momma, can I have this book?" and she smacked the SHIT out of him.  I told her to get out, and she threw a fit.
<BustaNutt> ABstruse, she beat the kid just for asking for a book?
<Abstruse> That's not even the most fucked up part.  The most fucked up part is that she worked for a shelter for battered women and children.
