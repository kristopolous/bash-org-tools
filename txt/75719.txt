* Phht frowns. Why the fuck did GTA3 get game of the year? -_-
<Corvus> Because it "broke the rules".
<Corvus> You got to be naughty.
<CGold> So what's going to be game of the year next year?
<CGold> "Michael Jackson's Pro Pedophelia 2003"?
<Corvus> Oh yeah.
<Corvus> Make sure you have Vibration turned On when you play it.
