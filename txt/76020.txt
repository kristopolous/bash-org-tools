<@madCoder> i need to decide .. do i curl up and go to sleep and waste the rest of the day, or do i go to my 2pm class? :|
<@Hatcher> what class
<@madCoder> calculus problem section
<@madCoder> i took calc in high school, got one of the highest grades on the exam last week :| do I really have to go? D:
<@madCoder> its not even the real class
<@madCoder> some grad student does a bunch of problems on the chalk board
<@madCoder> if you let me keep talking, i'll convince myself that school sucks and hibernate till after spring break
<@madCoder> ok then, that's settled
* madCoder is away: sleeping, be back in a few weeks
* madCoder is now known as madCoderhibarnating
