<@Hah|> A lot of you are way too attached to RO. If the servers go down permanently, I wonder how all of you guys would react.
<Dekar> I'm not that attached.
<Dekar> I mean sure, I love the game.. but if It went down, I would move on.
<com4> hah: i'd kill everyone.. in this room .. if the game went down.. and then i'd eat some yogurt
<com4> cuz you know yogurt tastes good. the fruit on the bottom stuff.. rocks.. and then i'd kill people
