<InkyGhost>Is it wrong to root for Tom Hank's character's death in "Castaway"?
<Rob> No, because its Tom Hanks.
<Rob> He starred in Mazes and Monsters, a blantant anti DnD film.
<Rob> Staring in porn is more respectable than being in that shit heap.
<Morrigan> Rob, that was before he was established. You have to take roles like that so you can get better ones.
<Rob> I don't care. Staring in porno would be more respectable than that.
<InkyGhost> You seem to have an unnatural fixation about seeing Tom Hanks in porn.
<Rob> Shut the fuck up, Ghost.
<Himi> Busted.
