<Taris> A hockey puck, mass 0.115kg, moving at 35 m/s, strikes an octopus thrown onto the ice by a fan.  The octopus has a mass of 0.265 kg.  The puck and octopus slide off together.  Find the velocity.
<Taris> yeah, this is one that the authors put in for those students that stay up late trying to do these
