<The-Jim> women can tell when other women are on though.
<harr|away> this family has a dog, a cat, and just added a bird
<harr|away> The-Jim: yes, generally by pheromones
<crickett> i can tell when girls on their their period too
<crickett> generally by the shouts
<crickett> followed by the "i love you" 's

<The-Jim> no crickett that's not why they won't have sex with you.

<crickett> i fail to see why i would be kicked for that comment
<The-Jim> Harr = woman
<crickett> thanks The-Jim
<The-Jim> Crickett = man making period jokes
<crickett> i dunno why that would offend
<crickett> i mean my slave didn't say anything about my black jokes
<crickett>  ... that might be because i cut his tongue out
