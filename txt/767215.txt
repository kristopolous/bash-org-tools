<ahref> GOD
<ahref> BETRAYED BY MY PHONE
<ahref> I was at school, and this hot girl started talking to me
<ahref> And she was all like "Hey, you're not as geeky as I thought you were"
<ahref> And I'm like "Yeah, I know. I'm actually not geeky at all."
<ahref> And then my phone starts ringing
<ahref> And it's the FF7 victory theme
