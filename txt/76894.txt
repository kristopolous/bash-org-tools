<DoctorRiff> well anyway, this drill sarge gets everyone lined up, and starts yelling at all the recruits, like how they do
<DoctorRiff> and he was over to the left of the line, when someone way off in the right yells "GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH!"
<DoctorRiff> and the drill sarge yells "WHO SAID THAT?!" and goes over and starts yelling at the right of the line
<DoctorRiff> then someone at the left of the line says "PATRICK HENRY YOU FOOL!"
<DoctorRiff> according to my dad's friend, it was worth all the extra jogging and military-type training they had to do
