<himitsu> Can anyone think of a science experiment i can do at home?
<himitsu> I have this assignment i have to do for year 10 science and i need to carry out an investigation.
<himitsu> Just give me a question i can find out,like do different brands of liquid paper dry faster and does brown ice cream melt faster than white.
<BastardKnight> Oh. Oh! Do an analysis of what happens when you mix a base and an acid as opposed to what happens you play bass and do acid. It'll be a smash hit.
