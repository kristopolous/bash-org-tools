<reek> stupid spam
<Phaet> dude, I haven't received spam for months!
<reek> lucky you :P
<Phaet> just reply to it like I did
<Phaet> I got this "Enlarge your penis today" spam so I replied "No, thank you. I already use Windows Vista"
<Phaet> The next day I read on yahoo news that one of the greatest spammers hanged himself
