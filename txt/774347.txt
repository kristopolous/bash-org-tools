<TxT> hahahhahahahahaha i read that bash quote where the guy renamed mirc.exe the .doc he needed to turn in
<TxT> so i did it with my paper, i get an email today from my teacher "Sorry, I opened your document and it seemed corrupted. Do you know what happened? If not, just resubmit your essay."
<TxT> and i sent him my now finished essay this morning and got a reply just now, "Thank you. This version seems to be working just fine."
