<d> yay I fixed my laptops battery!
<d> it was so dead, nothing would charge it
<d> so I gave it the electronic equivalent of a kick in the head, by shorting the +/- terminals for 5 minutes
<g> don't they have stickers on them that say they could explode or catch fire by doing that?
<d> yeah but it's ok, I took them off first.
