<Mercestes> ...omg, that reminds me...I made a faux pas at work..:(
<Mercestes> My boss was talking about this new "religious video game."  (he's catholic).
<Mercestes> and I went off on a tangent and I was like, "oh...wow, what happens when you lose?"
<Mercestes> and he turned his back and I threw out my arms like I was on a cross and went "Game Over!"
<Mercestes> and my other co=workers were like, "OMG!  I forbid you to do that ever again!" and he turned back around and went "what'd I miss?"
<Mercestes> no one would tell him.
<Mercestes> and then when it got quiet, I went "Continue?" and everyone started laughing again.
