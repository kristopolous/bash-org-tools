<Miliwen> Alucard, how the hell do you make a city in SimCity4?
<Alucard_the_Kook> Making a city is ... a lot like making love to a beautiful woman.
<Alucard_the_Kook> First you need to check her out, get the lay of the land.
<Alucard_the_Kook> Next, you need to tease her a little.  Make trails over her body, allowing you to move freely.
<Alucard_the_Kook> Then you fiddle with the zones.
<Alucard_the_Kook> Finally...
<Alucard_the_Kook> You give the bitch all your money.
