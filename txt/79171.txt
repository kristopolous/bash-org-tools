<Jabberwocky> my best friend has been trying to get me together with one of her friends. And I'm headed over there tonight to -NO INNUENDO HERE- install an ethernet card in her laptop.
<Jabberwocky> "Deirdre, I've been meaning to ask you this for a long time - almost from the day I met you. Would you... You know... Like to... Play some multiplayer games?"
