<Back2Basics> My wife thinks up the strangest reasons to get offline...
<Dralock> ?
<Dralock> Like what?
<Dralock> for her to get offline, or for oyou?
<Back2Basics> she says she's having contractions about 4 min apart or something...
<Dralock> Wow
<Dralock> sounds like she's having a baby
<Back2Basics> Right NOW ... so I have to get offline ... wish us luck...
