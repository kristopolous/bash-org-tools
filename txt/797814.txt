<balls>  that was the funniest thing that's ever happened to me
<balls>  im getting ready to build a computer, and my dad comes into my room.  he starts talking like hes giving me the talk about abstinence and shit.  he says stuff like "son, we want you to be safe, you know that" and just when it seems like he's gonna give me a condom, he holds out his hand, and he gives me a
fucking static wrist strap.
<balls>  i never laughed so hard in my dad's face.
