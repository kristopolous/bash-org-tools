<someone>: how good does txt compress?
<overmind>: rather good, they often can be compressed to 10% of their original volume
<someone>: no, i meant which one compresses better doc-files or txt, because I want to export my icq-history and in word it has 600 pages, so which one should i take?
<overmind>: take word and set the font size to 1, so you get the best compression
