(dosdemon)  theres just all these other car brands in sega gt
(dosdemon)  like "ford" and "chevy"
(dosdemon)  they must be real small
(dosdemon)  because they only have 2 cars to choose from
(dosdemon)  then you go to subaru and theres like "impreza wrx sti type r version b aspec 2"
(dosdemon)  "mitsubishi lancer evolution VII GS Tommi Makinen edtion"
(PACHUKA)  on an xbox that car would be mitsubi~1
