<Avalanche> i was at arbys last night eating, and this mini van pulls up. The soccer mom, daughter, and little brother hopped out and came in. The little kid was like 6-7. He said "mommy, I want a milkshake". She responded, "No, it will spoil your dinner". The little kid replied with, "YOU FUCKING CUNT, I WANT A GOD
DAMN MILKSHAKE". He got the milkshake.
<Avalanche> I never laughed so hard in my life
