<DarkKnight> I came home on Sunday night and I found my mom staring at me and looking annoyed.
<DarkKnight> I smelled her cooking and asked what she cooked and she responded by saying, "I didn't make any food for you!"
<DarkKnight> She seemed very pissed so I decide to go downstairs to avoid her.
<DarkKnight> When I was just about to leave she asked me if I bought a new game. I had no clue what she was talking about, so I said no.
<DarkKnight> "You sure? " she said, "nothing Male to Male?"
<DarkKnight> I was very confused and disturbed by this question because my mom seemed to be accusing me of being gay.
<DarkKnight> I said no again and she told me she found a box that said male to male on it.
<DarkKnight> I stood there and thought for a minute and then I realized what she was talking about. I ran downstairs and showed her what she looked at:
<DarkKnight> It was the box for my male-to-male s-video cord. My mom thought I was gay because I bought an s-video cord.
<silverpig> Just for kicks, you should leave the box for your 3 in 1 KVM cable laying around and she what she says about that.
