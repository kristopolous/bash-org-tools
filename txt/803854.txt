<Canopus>  ...I need to learn how to cook ribs.
<Kreldin>  The easiest way is to wrap them in tin foil, with a reservoir of spices and sauce and boil water beneath it to steam them. And then just cover it in dough to fry it.
<Kreldin>  Actually, I'm just making shit up off the top of my head. But that sounds like it would be awesome.
