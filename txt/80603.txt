<@Avalanche> The other night, I was at a friends house. And we had a bon-fire. I turned the lights out, got a marshmellow, set it on fire. Then began to run around the yard, with the marshmellow on fire, waving it in the air. Everyone was like "wtf are you doing". I said "guess what I am". They replied "I dont know".
I replied "space shuttle columbia". I thought it was funny joke, if you take away the sick tragedy of losing human life.
