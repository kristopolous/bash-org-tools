<Zoso> So me and my friend applied to the same electronics position in a store (think like Best Buy)
<Zoso> And he got the job even though he knows next to nothing about any of the games or hardware or anything
<Zoso> All because he looks more "presentable"
<Zoso> And at this store, your first couple of call-in help questions are done with the supervisor of your department
<Zoso> So last week, in the morning, i told him just some bullshit information...and I called in that day (with my voice disguised) to ask him about it
<Zoso> "Hello. I recently bought a 250GB external hard-drive...and while it's not very heavy now, I was wondering how much it will weigh when it's full."
<Zoso> The idiot responds with "Oh, don't worry sir, it's just a few pounds more."
<Zoso> ...so the supervisor hears the conversation...
<Zoso> And the stupid fucker got fired
*Zoso is away: filling out application...again
