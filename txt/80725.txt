[Nokturnal] I remember when i worked at holiday in...if our employees got a free stay, they had to have the "greencard" signed. it was just a little green card saying you worked at holiday inn. i once asked this one employee for his greencard and he went apeshit on me.
[Nokturnal]he's all "I GOT MY FUCKING GREENCARD YOU RACIST MOTHERFUCKER"
