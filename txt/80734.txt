<Destruya> Women are like errors, they're usually annoying and tend to fuck with your life right when you don't want them to.
<Destruya> Now, *girlfriends* are like fucking hard drive crashes.  They happen unexpectedly, completely fuck your shit up, and empty your fucking wallet.
<Destruya> But unlike most hard drives, women don't come with warranties.
<Destruya> "This bitch isn't compatible with me.  I want a new one."
<Japhro> 'look, you can't speak that way about my daughter, get the fuck out!'
