<Illogical> It is true of all Christian pop songs, that they are simply pop songs that have the word 'baby' replaced with 'Jesus.'
<Illogical> For example, "My loneliness is killing me, (and I) I must confess, I still believe (still believe). When I'm not with you I lose my mind, give me a sign... Hit me Jesus, one more time."
<Illogical> Or, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, when all your love is gone, who will save me from all I'm up against out in this world?"
<bec> what about something from this year?
<Illogical> "Tell me Jesus, what's your story? Where you come from, and where you wanna go this time?"
<Illogical> I rest my case.
