<TalonArkrys> Guys, I've decided that there needs to be an addition to the current laws of nature.  "Lesser Life Forms Are Not Allowed To Make Talon Feel Stupid".   I saw a bug on my kitchen floor, and it was rather unexpected.  As such, I threw my cup at it.  The cup was made of glass.  And contained my coke.  Now, I
have shattered glass as well as coke all over my floor.  The worst part was, when I looked closer, the bug was already dead.
