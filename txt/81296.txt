<b1u3> im not particularly worried that iraq start sending ppl over here...but i live in ca, right on the coast, if they did i'd taste the first wave
<b1u3> so right now im sittin here, all the lights turned off, in my faded army fatiques, new tank of co2 in my paintball gun, ready to give anyone to come through my door a hell of a bruise
