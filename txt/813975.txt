<Snakeman^Engineer> Do I sense some hatred towards Windows Vista originating from your direction?
<Chrysalid^Revenge> Oh no, not at all
* Chrysalid^Revenge stands up in a medieval recitation pose
<Chrysalid^Revenge> "OS X for the Mac users, pretentious in their coffeeshops
<Chrysalid^Revenge> Gentoo for the nerd-lords in their mother's basement
<Chrysalid^Revenge> XP for the everyday user, bound to muck around with bloody settings and registry values they should damn well leave alone
<Chrysalid^Revenge> Then Vista from the Dark Lord behind his desk
<Chrysalid^Revenge> In the Microsoft office, where crappy programming is performed
<Chrysalid^Revenge> One OS to eat your RAM, One OS to spy on your digital media
<Chrysalid^Revenge> One OS to screw them all, and in frustration bind them
<Chrysalid^Revenge> In the Microsoft office, where crappy programming is performed"
<Sectoid^Authopsy> Whoa!
