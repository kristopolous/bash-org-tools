<CapnDan> Oh god DAMN it.  I listed twenty cardboard boxes on freecycle on Saturday morning. 15 minutes later a guy had come to get them. Two minutes after that I posted that they were gone.
<CapnDan> I've gotten THREE DOZEN requests -- a dozen of them so far this morning -- for the god damned boxes.
<CapnDan> I felt sorry for the guy - he needed the cardboard boxes to move his wife out.
<ooPo> put her on freecycle
