<seaslug> the amish pick wierd names for their towns
<seaslug> for example, i've been to intercourse, pennsylvania
<ctkrohn> If there was a town named "sex" in Maine, it would be written on am envelope as Sex ME
<seaslug> it goes without saying that i've never been to intercourse
<bpt> "How did your trip go?" "I never made it to Orgasm"
