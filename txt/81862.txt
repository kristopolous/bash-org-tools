<Tancients> "I must rescue the bunny and feed her the daily amount of carrots!"
* Tancients encounters Serajadeyn!  *Screen spins and boss music starts playing*
* Serajadeyn dresses his stolen bunny in harem outfits and has her lavishing in comforts in the top of the tower. . .surrounded by silks and burning braizers, a wine cooler type stand next to the pillows with cold fresh carrots
<StolenBunny> XD
<Tancients> O_o
* Serajadeyn laughs at Tancients and hits him once doing quad 9 dmg
* Tancients counters the attack with long-named sword and returns the damage twice-fold!
<Tancients> Ha!
* Serajadeyn sucks up the damage, cackles and grabs Tancients, tossing him from the top of the tower: scripted battle; you loose
* Tancients is glad he saved up all his extra lives for this battle.  Regenerate ring:  God powers applied!
* Tancients casts Ultima ultimate imprisonment; customization: 1 prison cell for Serajadeyn.
* Serajadeyn taunts the would-be hero with a booming, evil voice; "YOU SHALL NEVAR RESCUE TEH BUNNY" (unfortunately it was the t/l's day off and some grad student filled in the script over the japanese taunts
* Tancients strikes at Serajadeyn with his long-named sword.  It shatters.  A stagehand quickly runs a new replacement for him.
<Serajadeyn> @_o;
<Tancients> :P
<Tancients> What can I say, the quality of props seems to be decreasing with budget cuts.
