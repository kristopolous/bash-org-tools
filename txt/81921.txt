<Mak> Aimee, well that's your opinion, and I have my opinion about you. I don't bring my opinion up, so I'd love it if in return you'd do the same, if only for common courtesy :)
<Aimee> I'd love to hear your opinion about me hon.
<Aimee> Perhaps you could write a book?
<Aimee> and name it "Things Aimee doesn't care about, by Makat"
<Mak> Chapter 1: Other people
