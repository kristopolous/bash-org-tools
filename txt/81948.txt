<@een> dude
<@een> today
<@een> i got so frustrated with this old man (took 30 minutes to create a dial up netowrking connection) that i finally told him that he had an ID 10 T keyboard error
<@een> and that he needed to call compaq
<@een> seriously couldn't backspace to delete out "MY CONNECTION" or even highlight to delete
<@een> fucking id10ts
