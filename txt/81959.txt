<Teratogen> The French Government announced today that it is enforcing a ban on the use of fireworks at Disneyland Paris.  The decision comes the day after a nightly fireworks display at the park, located just 30 miles outside of Paris, caused soldiers at a nearby French army garrison to surrender to a group of Czech
tourists .
