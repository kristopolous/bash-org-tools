<sarcasmo> i hate it when i cant kick ppl
<sarcasmo> im twice as fast as other ops on #af
<sarcasmo> cos i i have twice as less life than they do
<sarcasmo> and therefor im in there twice as often and long
<sarcasmo> i like how i type sentances that build up to a pyramid
<sarcasmo> and then after a while they go back slowly
<ValHeru> rofl
<sarcasmo> just as they are doing now i guess
<sarcasmo> but u kinda interrupted!
<sarcasmo> which wasnt nice
<sarcasmo> -.-
