Some cool info: Tibeten monks, after twenty years or so of practise in the Himalaya, control their brain stem - they can control their heart beat, blood pressure etc.  After thirty years they can connect to the internet purely by meditation, setting TCP stacks in their neurons and stuff.  Right now I am chatting with
a monk who is sitting naked in an ice storm on his towel, his only possesion.  He's using ipv6.
