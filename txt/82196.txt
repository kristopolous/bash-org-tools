#82196 +(169)- [X]
* Avie|work tabs back in *
<Avie|work> what are you _talking_ about?
<ithil> I started with 22 as the lowest possible base, got 210, added 9, noticed 219 was a factor of 3 (216 + 3), and realized it was going to stay that way. :P
<Xrtsys> Wait.  The three rule breaks down in non-/10 bases.
<DND> virgin girls are cool
* PxM watches Avie tab back out
<Avie|work> some people are talking about virgins, some people are talking about math, someone said something about God, and _I_ thought you were still talking about typology.
