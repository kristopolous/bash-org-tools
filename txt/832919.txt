CDSBIGSBY: at work, on the like, 'keyboard' for the cash registers, there are two buttons that don't do anything
CDSBIGSBY: and it's like, the button, a little slip of paper that says what the button does, and a plastic cover that holds the paper in
CDSBIGSBY: and this dude at work figured that out, 'cause he popped the plastic cover off
CDSBIGSBY: and so we made labels for the two 'empty' buttons on the registers we were on that day
CDSBIGSBY: he didn't utilize the full potential of the opportunity though, as one of his buttons is a happy face and the other a sad face
CDSBIGSBY: but i feel i did mine justice.
CDSBIGSBY: Lane 14 at Meijer's has a Self-Destruct button and a Bat Signal button.
