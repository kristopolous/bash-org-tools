<joeofparma> On a Christmas Eve so freezing, I commenced my quest displeasing,
<joeofparma> Through the crowded shops and busy stores of flashy Yuletide glee.
<joeofparma> In I hustled quickly tiring, looks of hopelessness inspiring,
<joeofparma> To the salesman inquiring, "Have you a Nintendo Wii?"
<joeofparma> "Sorry, sir" was his reply "for I have no Nintendo Wii.
<joeofparma> All that's left is PS3."
