<Larno> I got terribly smashed the night before
<Larno> And some electricity cable broke down in my street
<Larno> it was like 6am postman and garbage dudes were there- watching them workin on it and the street was blocked by police cars
<Larno> eventually they knocked at my door so i m in front of a cop, a worker with his helmet a garbage mate,  a postman and my neighbour- a huge black guy who works in IT
<Larno> and all I can say is  "oh maan the village people became jheovah witnesses"
