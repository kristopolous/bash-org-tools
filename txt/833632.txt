Zintuki: I would use all the sexual frustration to support my theory that it is NOT "better to have loved and lost that to have never loved at all."
xShadowGunnx:  idk, I agree with that theory. Even if I don't sleep at night because of it or form functioning relationships with new women anymore.
Zintuki: wait.... You've had a functioning relationship with a woman BEFORE?
