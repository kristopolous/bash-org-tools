<Macavity> I'm growing a beard. It's really itchy, growing a beard...
<fin> Then shave.
<Macavity> But I weant a beard for I-Con.
<Macavity> And a real one, not a spirit-gummed-on fake one.
<fin> Why?
<Macavity> Just...because I do. Because it's part of the look for a LARP character I have.
<fin> OK. Stop there. I don't want to know anymore. Goddamn.
<Macavity> BECAUSE I FUCKING FEEL LIKE GROWING A BEARD, OKAY?
<Macavity> Shiiiit....
<fin> Which part of "changing your appearance to fit in with a LARP character" doesn't sound stupid to you?
<Maestro|OoT> LARP?
<Furry_Geek> Live Action Role Playing.
<Maestro|OoT> Oh, NO.
<fin> OK, scratch that. Which part of "playing a LARP" doesn't sound stupid to you?
