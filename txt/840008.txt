<Krys> I had the funniest phone call last night when I was at work
<Krys> had to tell the guy to buy a new SIM card, because he fried his..and he was like "Okay thanks" and we ended the call..except he forgot to hang up
<Krys> so I had my phone on mute and all you hear is "Stupid bitch" and he goes on insulting me...so I give him a few moments
<Krys> I go on the line and I'm like "Sir, you may want to disconnect the line. I'm still here"
<Krys> and he's like "OH FUCK" *click*
