<Deco> Two pakis in a Golf tried to cut in in front of me and nearly hit my car. Then they followed me even though it was their fault. They stopped next to me at the next set of traffic lights and the passenger said "I'll follow you home". I replied "Follow me to your mom's". You've never seen me drive as fast as I
did trying to get away from them.
<Deco> I loved the look of his face, though.
