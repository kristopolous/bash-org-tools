<Thalog> is it just me, or has our society come to the realisation of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451?
<Thalog> I recall being in a car filled with 5 people, excluding myself
<Thalog> but no one was talking
<Thalog> everyone was doing things on their cell phones and such
<UlsterResident> ah, yeah

<Thalog> and when they did talk, they didn't really say anything in particular
<UlsterResident> I'm gunna go watch some TV
