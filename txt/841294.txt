<+ajrez> same job when i moved across the street the cubes were lower, typical gray, and huge, 8x10 or something
<+ajrez> at that location i ran some 2x4s up to 7' and covered my cube with camoflage netting
<+ajrez> so in the middle of this giant room filled with cubes there was this bunker in the middle of it
<+ajrez> CEO would give tours to investors... "and that over there is the security team"   "ohhhhhhh" /knowing nods/
