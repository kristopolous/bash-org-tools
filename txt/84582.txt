<MexHammer> I mean, come on, aren't at least 20% of Star Trek episodes ones where they end up going back to Earth circa 1920 - 1945? They have millions of planets and who knows how much time and they have hundreds of episodes with that premise? If Star Trek was a person, it'd be you. And I'd beat it up.
