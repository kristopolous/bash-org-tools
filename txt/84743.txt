Ubergamer: I think the idea that good things come to those who wait comes from the fact that, due to probability theory, on a long enough timeline there is a good chance that at least two good things will occur
Ben: or it's a saying started by people who don't wait that want more good things for themselves
Ben: so they tell those who wait to keep waiting
Ubergamer: they should modernize that saying

Ben: haha
Ben: and said thusly, one can see the absurdity
Ben: we have successfully debunked an aphorism
Ubergamer: yay!
