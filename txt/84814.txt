<CommanderStab> When I was 10 me and this friend of mine who was four years older than me made this Visual Basic game called Fatal Move. Basically these pictures he drew would pop up with some text like "This guy is a geek! Let's kill him!!" and then if you clicked yes another picture would be shown with him dead, and
if you clicked no some guy called you a wimp and the game quit.
<Bleeding> did the irony of u saying 'lets kill geeks' in a game u wrote in vb ever sink in?
<CommanderStab> His character was called "Carrot Head" and he was this cool looking carrot with a special knife.
<CommanderStab> My chracter was "Unco-body the Head Shaker" who was some retarded guy with a gun he couldn't aim properly with, and he just sat there laughing goofily all the time.
<Bleeding> gee let me guess who wore the pants in ur friendship
