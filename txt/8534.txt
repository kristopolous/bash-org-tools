<Ookey> it's the pop ups that I just want to rip out of the computer, and stomp on repeatedly
<Ookey> especially when, like the one I just had, the only way to get rid of the 10 or so that you have + ones that are opening every 2-3 secs is to close down all of ie, and loose any pages etc that you have
<JtHM> are you going to that 'YES, I AM LOOKING AT GAY PORN' page?
