* Avatar|NO3 gives Crispy a can of Lone Star beer
<Crispy> never heard of it
<Avatar|NO3> It's vile. Even Mexicans won't drink it.
<Avatar|NO3> In a choice between Lone Star and piss, 80% of people chose piss. For the flavor.
<Zurvan> and the other 20%?
<Avatar|NO3> The other 20% thought both cups had piss.
