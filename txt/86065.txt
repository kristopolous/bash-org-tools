<CommanderStab> Man, all of these supposed "free PHP hosting" sites and not one of them is any good >_<
<CommanderStab> WTF?
<Riku> o.o
<CommanderStab> Hungarian?!
<CommanderStab> These guys actually have INTERNET?!
<CommanderStab> Man, I can't read this shit >_<
<CommanderStab> I have the greatest idea for a site
<CommanderStab> Say that we ofer 1000mb of fre PHP hosting
<CommanderStab> Then when they submit their information we keep their password and username and don't give them a site
<CommanderStab> Then we build a massive database of usernames and poasswords
<CommanderStab> Then we create a program to goes to every site on the itnernet that requires a password and get it to try all of the user/passes we have on every site
<CommanderStab> Then we blackmail the people because no doubt some of the sites are like sick porn sites and we'll have their email addresses
<CommanderStab> And we use the money that we get out of the blackmail to actually BUY some decent hosting
<CommanderStab> So I don't have to keep looking through all this shit
