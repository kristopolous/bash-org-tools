<Snow> If Grand Theft Auto isn't mankind's greatest invention, I don't know what is.
<Snow> I just flew around the city in an Apache attack helicopter firing missiles and random cars. And when I got bored of that, I stole some guys motorcycle, rode 120mph across town to a nightclub, where I picked up $10,000, walked inside, and fired a minigun into the crowd, liquifying everyone inside.
<Snow> And then I picked up a new suit and went home and called it a day.
<dano> i love how accurate its portrayal of the 1980s night-life is
