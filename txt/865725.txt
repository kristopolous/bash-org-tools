Tazoa: No one has crashed more cars then me. I backed my truck into a rock camping once. Broke the differential cover.
Recaro: Shit how'd you get home man?
Tazoa: I fiberglassed it back together. turns out differential oil passes right through fiberglass.
Recaro: Sounds about right
Tazoa: so I popped it back open and pushed some bananas in there to thicken the mixture. Long story short i drove 700 miles with two bananas in my rear end.
