<^Migs^> the way I see it, if a school district is going to block something that's useful for educational, they need to provide an alternative
<^Migs^> e.g., if you block YouTube, host your own media sharing site.
<^Migs^> if you block Myspace or Facebook, host your own social network
<^Migs^> etc.
<tensai> if you block porn, host your own naked pictures
