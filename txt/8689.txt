#8689 +(336)- [X]
<MMouse> the dates I started and left positions "dont give an accurate impression of how long you worked at that position"
<drewb> god, it almost sounds like you were deliberately vague about dates to hide the fact you didnt last long in a job..
<Tippytoes> what format did you put the dates in, max?
<SataniKKa> roman numerals
<Sep> binary
<SataniKKa> Monday is not a date.
