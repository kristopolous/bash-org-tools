<Phoenix> what should i do a human factors research paper about?
<Neal> catgirls
<Phoenix> well, coincidentally I also have to do a Japanese thesis paper
<Phoenix> and writing about anime/manga/catgirls/mawaii would be not at all out of line with what all the other undergrads in the major are doing for their SENIOR THESIS, and so it's really no wonder that the department head no longer gives a flying fuck about any of his students
<Neal> my thesis is on why the escalation of power in dragon ball z is unrealistic
<Phoenix> with the exception of Goku*
<Neal> my thesis is FRIEZA SUX!!!!!
<Phoenix> Working from the equation PowLev(X+1) = PowLev(X) * 1.10, I find it illogical that two super seiyan's with respective levels 100,000 and 500,000 should be able to subdue another super seiyan with power level 750,000
<Phoenix> From that perspective, this paper attempts to repudiate the outcome of the Battle of Dragon Mount and propose an alternate ending to the Dragon Ball Z saga
