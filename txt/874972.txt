<Chris281>Dude, i had a really weird dream last night
<Chris281>I kept dreaming that all of my data was lost because my harddrives crashed
<Chris281>And my backups were nowhere to be found, so the situation was fubar
<Chris281>So I woke up, soaked in sweat and checked whether my backupjob was running
<Chris281>And it wasn't because for some reason the LTO drive was jammed
<Vantheman>It's the classic nerd-shining
