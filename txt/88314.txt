<b1u3> i got this college professor who forgets stuff all the time, every week, the first half of his routine is the ending half of the previous session
<b1u3> finally some dude jumped up and went 'yo man, you already told us about file transfer protocol', so the prof asks where we are, the guy tells him, the rest of the day runs smooth
<b1u3> now we're learning twice as much and the guy who spoke up got his car egged four fucken times this week, community college is da rulz
