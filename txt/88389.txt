<Born_In_East_LA_2> We should tell all the now free Iraqi people about how France wanted them to remain under Hussein's rule, so that way they'll raise their kids to hate France instead of us.
<uni> Yeah :)
<kuribo> yeah
<kuribo> but then the iraqi kids will go to france and confront them
<kuribo> and france will surrender
<kuribo> and then france will become new iraq
