Anatole: I like when my dog thinks I'm going to get up, so he gets up to follow me, then I don't and he looks at me then goes for a walk like he was going to walk anyway. He thinks he's people.
Melthar: He thinks he's 'people'? He has a split personality?
Anatole: Yeah, like last night he's going on about how he'll teach me to use the force, then today he's all "We can conquer China by next week".
Furr: Your dog said this?
Anatole: It's fucked up having a dog with an MPD man.
