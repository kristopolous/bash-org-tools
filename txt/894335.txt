<Chi>: So we went to the pool hall last Wednesday...
<Chi>: I ended up paying for everyone when we finished.
<Chi>: Everyone asked how much it cost afterwards.
<Chi>: I told them that I used my Asian powers to get no charge.
<Chi>: Then on our way down the stairs...
<Chi>: I jumped onto the carpet in front of the door and exclaimed...
<Chi>: "Okay Abz, time to use your Arabian powers to fly us home!"
<Chinh>: did it work?
<Chi>: No, the carpet was black.
<Chinh>: zing!
