<Flibberdy> thank fuck my wife's period's finally over. Stupid biological mechanisms required for reproduction.
<fantasyprone> Flibberdy, try being the one bleeding from a very private crevice
<fantasyprone> believe me it sucks at least as much for her as for you
<Flibberdy> fantasyprone: Oh, she hates it too, don't get me wrong. Honestly I'm glad it's over for her sake not mine
<Flibberdy> Left her bed bound quite a few days
<fantasyprone> though it does entertain me to play war paint in the shower
<fantasyprone> BLOOD EVERYWHERE WOO
