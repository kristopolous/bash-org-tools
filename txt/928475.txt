Matoyak: We caught a catfish with some weird-ass face tentacles...
Matoyak: That's the best way I can describe these things.
Tru: lol
Tru: I thought weird-ass face tentacles was a defining characteristic of catfish...
Matoyak: It wasn't like whiskers...these things were half as long as the fish itself, and almost as thick.
Matoyak: Heh, these were above and beyond the call of duty for catfish face tentacles.
Matoyak: Weird-ass sunovabitch.
Tru: hehehe
Tru: mutant
Matoyak: Yeah. It was big enough to keep, but we tossed it back cause we weren't going to eat something that looked that fucked up.
Tru: if  you eat a mutant catfish, perhaps you get mutant catfish superpowers... I wonder what those would be?
Matoyak: ...
Matoyak: The ability to become a bottom-sucking scum eater?
Matoyak: Hrmmm
Matoyak: So you become a politician.
