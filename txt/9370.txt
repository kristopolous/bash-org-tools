<stank> guys.. i went out tonight.
<stank> i pretended to be a normal college student.
<stank> and i stood uncomfortably on a porch with a bunch of people i don't know.
<stank> but then i ran into bill and will, who were pretending in the same way.
<stank> so we talked about networks and i felt better.
