<+ChubZee> i was watching telly this morning before i went to work
<+ChubZee> and there was a discussion on about a charity that deals with teenage pregnancy
<+ChubZee> which is a huge problem in the uk
<+FCN|M0rlock> i can imagine
<+ChubZee> and they're advocating anal sex as a form of contraception
<+ChubZee> (which i'm all for)
<+ChubZee> and their tag line is "one up the bum and you won't be a mum"
<+ChubZee> i was almost dying laughing
