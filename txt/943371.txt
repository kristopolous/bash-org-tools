<@jackc> btw
<@jackc> I had a VHDL nightmare last night
<@jackc> I was dreaming about VHDL right
<@jackc> and I moved a little and my stuffed alligator touched my elbow
<@jackc> and I FREAKED and for some reason the dream was like VHDL MONSTER ATTACK
<@jackc> and I sat up and was trying to figure out which parts were reality
<@jackc> and all I could figure out were VHDL, elbow, alligator
<@jackc> I was so confused
<@jackc> that's what I get for reading VHDL textbooks in bed
