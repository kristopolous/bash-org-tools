<Alvie> we have too much fun in #ops
<Gandalf> yes its a very professional environment
<Gandalf> hmmm
<Gandalf> there is a difference between #staff and #ops though
<Gandalf> an example you ask?
<Gandalf> no problem!
<Gandalf> ops:  <Alvie> concering my sack and his chin
<Gandalf> staff: <Arathorn> I thought that ICMP message types offered a reasonably well thought out protocol for tracerouting
