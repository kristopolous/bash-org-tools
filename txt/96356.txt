<black-ice> this girl I went out with last night was pretty cute.
<black-ice> I can't believe she said 'no' for a second date.
<black-ice> We had a lot of fun, right up until I beat her at chess.
<goKev> DUDE!  You took a girl out on a CHESS DATE and you're trying to figure out why you didn't get a second date?!?!
<black-ice> Good point.  I probably should have let her win.
