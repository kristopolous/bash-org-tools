<Gho5t> i decided against that php bumper sticker
<Gho5t> i don't want my friends from home to think i turned into a super geek
<Gho5t> i can just imagine what would happen when they ask what 'php' meant
<ASleep>hah
<ASleep>I don't drive so my PHP sticker is on my laptop.
<ASleep> Of course, I'm getting my php tattoo this weekend so it doesn't matter.
