<Lucien>  a small question.. will you rewrite you're history books now that you hate us and write that US should have been liberated even with OUT massive support from french military?  and maybe benjamin franklin never got his idees from paris? maybe he didn't even visite the country...
<Stormrider> Lucien, do you speak German?
<Lucien> no, but swedish :P
<Stormrider> You don't speak German, though?
<Lucien> eh no
<Stormrider> You're welcome.
